Do you really edit the whole thing yourself? I heard Joe Rogan talk about your process on his podcast and wasn&#8217;t sure his description was accurate. He basically stated you just sit there on a macbook and do the whole show start to finish? If this is the case, good job!<br/>

yeah I do the whole thign. On season 1 I had an editor and we shared it about half. But season two i edited without any help. It was fucking hard. and yes, i sit at the macbook and just put it together from start frame to finish.<br/>
