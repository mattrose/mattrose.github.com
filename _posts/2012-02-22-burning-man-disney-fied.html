<p>I can&#8217;t get over my absolute horror.  I&#8217;ve worked hard on multiple installations over the years (my absolute fave is, of course, Matisse&#8217;s FSG), and the fact that there are people who think that an invite-only Krug-sponsored party is in any way representative of Burning Man really makes me want to puke all over my shoes.   The fact that I, and a lot of other people worked our asses off for the enjoyment of some spoiled uber Sparkle Ponies makes me want to projectile vomit into the next county</p>
