title: 'You know, when I call @TheBanditas hardcore, Liz always argues with me, and says that bands like Bikini Kill are way more hardcore.  After watching this, I’m pretty sure that Liz could take Kathleen Hanna. twentyfourbit:  Watch: Kathleen Hanna Sings “Smells Like Teen Spirit” + “Rebel Girl” Iconic punk/riot grrrl singer Kathleen Hanna, Beastie Boy Ad-Rock (her husband, Adam Horovitz, of course), and others performed at NYC’s Joe’s Pub earlier this week for the latest in the “Our Hit Parade” series, a string of concerts inspired by an old radio show that ran from the mid-1930s to late-’50s in which cast members would perform sketches based on popular songs. For their performance, Hanna and friends adjusted the formula a bit by taking on the hits of the ’90s with Hanna reminiscing on her salad days hanging out with the likes of Kurt Cobain (she says she penned the words “Smells Like Teen Spirit” on his wall with a Sharpie while drunk, which, obviously, went on to inspire a certain song by the same name) before breaking into two different versions of said infamous grunge anthem — one lounge-y take and a distorted guitar-backed faithful version. Oh, and then they rock out to Bikini Kill’s “Rebel Girl” with Ad-Rock on the bass. Enjoy this completely awesome clip (note: parts are NSFW) above. '
