<p>This joke is going around Facebook these days, but I can&#8217;t find any real attribution, just a bunch of names that peter out&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A unionized public employee, a member of the Tea Party, and a CEO are sitting at a table. In the middle of the table there is a plate with a dozen cookies on it. The CEO reaches across and takes 11 cookies looks at the Tea Partier and says,&#8221;look out for that union guy, he wants a piece of your cookie.&#8221;</p>
