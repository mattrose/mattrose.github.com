Sir David Richards, the head of British forces, has declared that a military victory against al-Qa&#8217;ida and the Taliban is not possible. Attempts by the West to achieve this were unnecessary, said Sir David Richards, the Chief of General Staff, who also defended the right of fundamentalist Muslims to adhere to beliefs which underpin their lives. He stressed that one cannot defeat ideas merely through fighting wars.
