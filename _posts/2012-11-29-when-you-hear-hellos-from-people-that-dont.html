title: 'The truth and the bike. - Alison Tetrick'

When you hear “hellos” from people that don’t shave their legs, have any kind of bike with bells and whistles, and a neon yellow jacket. And then you see it. You see that smile. That pure smile that only means one thing. Utter joy. You can’t help but giggle. You can’t help but love every second of it. it doesn’t matter if you are turning squares or circles. It doesn’t matter if you are riding for 12 miles or 100 miles. You are on your bike, and you are happy.
