The CAD was at 1.10 USD.&nbsp; At my favourite currency watching site <a href="http://www.xe.com/">http://www.xe.com/</a>, they actually have a note on the CAD-USD section. that says:<br /><br /><blockquote>Rate Explanation.  <br />This rate means that the Canadian Dollar is worth <b><u>more</u></b> than the USD.<br /></blockquote><br />So proud.
