title: 'ipod tip from the well'
---
just so I don't forget, and in case anyone wants to know, i found this tip for showing voltage on an ipod<br /><br />WRT checking battery life, you can ask the current owner to do this on<br />&nbsp;a Mac:<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;touch /Volumes/iPodname/iPod_Control/Device/_show_voltage<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Or on a PC, create a file named _show_voltage (no file extension) in<br />&nbsp;iPod_Control/Device via notepad or something.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;This will force the iPod to display a numeric readout of the battery<br />&nbsp;voltage ranging from 0 to 519. If you ask the owner to fully charge it<br />&nbsp;and then let it play for 10 minutes to see how much it depletes, you'll<br />&nbsp;have a good idea of the quality of the battery.<br /><br />
