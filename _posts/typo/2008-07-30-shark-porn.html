<blockquote></br>
The single fatality resulting from an unprovoked attack in 2007 was recorded from New Caledonia. This is the fewest number of fatalities in two decades (the previous low was 0 in 1987). The mean number of unprovoked deaths from 2000-2007 is 5.0 per year. The number of serious attacks in the current decade, as measured by fatality rate (7.6%), has been lower than that of the 1990's (12.3%), continuing the downward trend of the twentieth century. This reduction in fatality rate is reflective of advances in beach safety practices and medical treatment, and increased public awareness of avoiding potentially dangerous situations. </blockquote>
