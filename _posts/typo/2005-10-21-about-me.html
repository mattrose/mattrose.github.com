Matt Rose is a 32 year old male doing Product Support for a small software company in the town formerly known as Kanata, now part of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  His interest include Linux, music, international politics, and socio-economics.  He plays keyboards in The Mighty Eagle Band, but mainly does it cause he really likes band practice.  Matt is finding it really weird writing about himself in the third person, so he's going to finish this off by showing you a picture of what he looks like.</br>
