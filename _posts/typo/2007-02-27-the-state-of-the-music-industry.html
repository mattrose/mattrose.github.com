<br />I think this is a great idea, not so much as an anti-RIAA protest movement, but as a bunch of good ideas for supporting artists who are trying to work outside of the record industry.&nbsp; If you go to a record store this month, look for the album by an independent artist on an independent label.<br /><br /><a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/home-entertainment/putting-our-money-where-our-mouths-are-boycott-the-riaa-in-march-239281.php">Putting Our Money Where Our Mouths Are: Boycott the RIAA in March - Gizmodo</a> <br /> <blockquote>Gizmodo is declaring the month of March Boycott the RIAA month. We want to get the word out to as many people as humanly possible that we can all send a message by refusing to buy any album put out by an RIAA label. Am I saying you should start pirating music? Not at all. You can continue to support the artists you enjoy and respect in a number of ways.

Firstly, I encourage everyone to purchase music from unsigned bands and bands on independent record labels. There are tons of great artists out there, many of which you're probably already a fan of, that have nothing to do with the RIAA. Buy their records at eMusic, an online store that sells independent tunes in beautiful, DRM-free MP3 format.</blockquote>
