On Facebook, you become friends with people
On Twitter, you follow people.

I kinda like the twitter metaphor better, words are descriptive, and while I wouldn't consider Lance Armstrong a "friend", I am interested in what he has to say.  Also, <a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/12/extra-ordinary-from-publicity-to-p-fars.html">following his drug tests are interesting</a>.  Friend has so much extraordinary baggage.  I would be embarassed to ask Lance Armstrong to be my "friend" on Facebook.  Both 'cause it appears dorky in the extreme, and because I don't really want to be friends with Lance Armstrong.  He'd always be lecturing me about smoking...
