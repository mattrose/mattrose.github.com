I've done a lot of work behind the scenes lately to the various programs that make up the web portion of the folkwolf.  </br>
</br>
1.  I've installed <a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress</a>, the software that is running this frontpage.  I like it so far, it's much easier to administer than moveabletype, plus, you can add yourself as a user, and make posts, if you like.</br>
</br>
2.  I've upgraded gallery to the final beta of 2.0.  This version is far more secure by design, and also a lot easier to administer.</br>
</br>
3.  I've played around with squirrelmail, and so far it has not made me happy.  It's ugly, it doesn't do folders properly (or how I think it should).  I'll do some more playing around with it, as well as a bit more hunting, but if anyone comes across a nice webmail app, lemme know.
