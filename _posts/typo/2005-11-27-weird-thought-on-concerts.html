title: 'Weird thought on Concerts'
---
I went to see U2 Friday night, and while I was waiting for the Arcade Fire, my thoughts turned to Pearl Jam, and how, to combat bootleggers, they released CDs for the entire tour, one CD per show.  The distribution and marketing of that was apparently a nightmare, and they had to fight their record company to do it.  So the idle thought is:  Why does every band not release MP3s or some DRMed version of MP3, of their show after it's done?   Put the MP3s up on their website, charge $5 for it, and that would be a way to make even more money from shows, which seem to be the only way that musicians make money these days.
