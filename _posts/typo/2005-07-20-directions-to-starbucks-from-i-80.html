title: 'Directions to Starbucks from I 80'
---
As some of you may know, liz and I often drive down to burning man in Nevada.  It's a straight haul from Gary, Indiana to San Francisco, and every year, one of the most unpleasant things about the drive is the weak-ass dishwater that truck stops along the I80 try to pass off as coffee.</br>

So I decided to look up locations of starbucks in towns along the route.  This makes me stupidly happy.</br>
