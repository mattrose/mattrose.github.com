title: 'The state of Somalia'

As some of you may know, I spent two years (1985 - 87) in Somalia, I left Mogadishu while it was at its peak, before the civil war that started to destroy the country.  I read all of the articles on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/somalia/default.stm">this page</a> from the BBC.  It makes for fascinating reading.
