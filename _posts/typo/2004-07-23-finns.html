I can't stand it when other people pass around their lame jokes in emails that I'm not interested in.  So when I find a good joke I just put it on my webpage.  </br>
</br>
 A Finn and a Swede walk into a bar.  The Finn sets a bottle of vodka</br>
 on the table and pours two glasses.  Neither says a word.</br>
                                                                                </br>
 When both glasses are empty, the Finn refills the glasses.  The two</br>
 men continue to drink, staring silently across the table, with the Finn</br>
 refilling the glasses after each round.</br>
                                                                                </br>
 Eventually the bottle is empty.  After a short pause, the Swede says,</br>
 "You think we should get another bottle?"</br>
                                                                                </br>
 "Did we come here to drink or talk?" says the Finn.
