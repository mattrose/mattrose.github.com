title: 'Blog Speed Improvements'
---
Those of you who've tried to visit lately have noticed that the blog is almost unusably slow these days.  I've tried to fix this by changing around a lot of the back end stuff.  It's  described in the new <a href="/pages/installation">Installation page</a>.  I'll be monitoring it over the next few days to see if it's improved as much as I've hoped.  If not, I may just hack on either the sample blog app that comes with <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/bits/campingAMicroframework.html">Camping</a> or the one that comes with <a href="http://www.nitroproject.org/">Nitro</a>.  If there's one thing I've learned lately it's that writing a blog is easy.  Writing a decent one is hard.</br>
</br>
UPDATE:  My plans suffered a huge setback when <a href="http://scottstuff.net/blog/">Scott Laird</a>submitted a <a href="http://scottstuff.net/blog/articles/2006/08/17/the-typo-4-1-development-cycle-has-begun">huge patch</a> to <a href="http://www.typosphere.org">Typo</a> That simultaneously broke (temporarily) the entire blog, and (permanently) the two custom sidebars I wrote.  I'll re-write the sidebars.
