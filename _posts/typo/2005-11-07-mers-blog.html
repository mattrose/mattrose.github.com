Mer and Colin have <a href="http://treekick.blogspot.com/">set up a blog</a> where they announced the long-awaited (at least if you talk to Mom) date for their wedding</br>
</br>
I need to set up a blog roll for friends and family.  I know Geoff has a blog that he never posts to, but I can't find it anymore.
