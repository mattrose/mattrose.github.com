<a href="http://www.bloglines.com"> Bloglines</a> is my new favourite utility/web site.  A long time ago I discovered blogs, but my memory is horrible, and I would go months forgetting to check them.  Then I discovered RSS feed readers.  <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/>NetNewsWire on the Mac was an early feed reader, but I don't have a Mac, so I was out of luck.  Then the <a href="http://liferea.sf.net">Linux Feed Reader</a> for <a href="http://www.gnome.org">the GNOME desktop</a> came out, and I started using that.  It's pretty good, and it integrates well into the desktop, but it has one big drawback.  It's only available on the desktop, so I can't check it from where ever I am.  My rule, it seems, is that everything I do has to be network-transparent.  Normally, I would find an RSS reader that I could install on my website, but one doesn't seem to exist yet, really.  Bloglines fits all my criteria, and will do nicely until I write my own.  The other feature I like is the clippings folder.  I have at least three or four more blog entries stored there.   Go check it out
