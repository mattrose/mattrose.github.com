<p>Every morning when I worked in Oakland, I would get on the <a href="http://bayarea.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/riders-say-goodbye-to-some-sf-bus-lines/">7-Haight </a>at the corner of Divisadero and Haight St. in San Francisco.  The 7-Haight would take me to the BART line under Market St, which would then take me to work in Oakland. </p>
