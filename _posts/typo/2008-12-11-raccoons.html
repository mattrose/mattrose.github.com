title: 'Raccoons.'

Another poem by Jane Hirshfield.  </br>

</br>
<pre> </br>
 This August night, raccoons,</br>
 come to the back door</br>
 burnished all summer by salty,</br>
 human touch: enter secretly & eat.</br>
 </br>
 Listen, little mask-faced ones,</br>
 unstealthy bandits whose tails</br>
 are barred with dusk:</br>
 listen, gliding green-eyed ones:</br>
 I concede you gladly</br>
 all this much-handled stuff,</br>
 garbage, grain,</br>
 the cropped food and cropped heart.</br>
 may you gnaw in contentment</br>
 through the sleep-hours</br>
 on everything left out.</br>
 </br>
 May you find the house</br>
 hospitable,</br>
 well-used,</br>
 stocked with sufficient goods.</br>
 I'll settle with your leavings,</br>
 </br>
 as you have settled for mine,</br>
 before startling back into darkness</br>
 that marks each of us so differently.</br>
</pre>
