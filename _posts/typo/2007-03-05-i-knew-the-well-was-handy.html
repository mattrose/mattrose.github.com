I've been wondering about this for a while.<br /><blockquote>Topic 1635 [macintosh]:&nbsp; Garage Band!<br />#351 of 355: John F. Whitehead (jfw)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fri Mar&nbsp; 2 '07 (22:57)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 lines<br /><br />&nbsp;you can do those to some extent with garageband.&nbsp; if they're orange<br />&nbsp;tracks convert them to purple first (ctrl-opt-g) and then the region<br />&nbsp;editor will allow you to adjust them.<br /><br />&nbsp;if you need more features, Logic Express and of course Logic give you<br />&nbsp;a lot more control.<br /></blockquote>
