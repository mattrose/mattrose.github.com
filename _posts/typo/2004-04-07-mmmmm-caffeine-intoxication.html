From the New York Times

After the habitual two cups of Starbucks coffee, Adam set to work. So far, so good. But as the academic pressure mounted, he had to work longer hours, and that meant more coffee â€” a lot more coffee than he had ever consumed in his life. In fact, for six weeks, he had been drinking up to 10 cups of Starbucks coffee daily.

That is a lot of caffeine, considering that each large cup contains on average about 375 milligrams, according to a 2003 study of caffeinated coffee published in The Journal of Analytical Toxicology. With 10 cups a day, Adam was turbocharged with nearly four grams of caffeine.

So Adam was not just nervous about his academic work; he was also suffering from caffeine intoxication.
