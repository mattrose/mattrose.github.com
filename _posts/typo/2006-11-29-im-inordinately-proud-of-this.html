This is a <a href="/files/gimp-mac.tiff">Screen shot</a> of <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">the GIMP</a>, a program designed for the X Windows system, running natively on Quartz, on my beloved MacBook.  I of course take all the credit here, but it's all due to the good people at <a href="http://www.imendio.com">Imendio</a>, who are porting GTK  over to Quartz.  You can read about their efforts</br>
