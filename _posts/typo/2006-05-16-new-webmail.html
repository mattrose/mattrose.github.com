I installed squirrelmail.  They finally got it working right so that I could use it with UW-IMAP and pine, and it's less complicated and badly ambitious than the horde/imp webmail I was using before.  It looks pretty ugly right now, but I might prettify it and add the address book feature in soon.  As it is, hammer away at it <a href="http://www.folkwolf.net/smail/">here</a>
