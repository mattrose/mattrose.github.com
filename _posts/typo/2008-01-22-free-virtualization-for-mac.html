title: 'Free Virtualization for Mac'
---
I've finally hopped on the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> bandwagon.  I've been excited about Ubuntu for quite some time, and I've been meaning to try it since <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/">dapper drake</a>, or so, but due to a lack of hardware and time, I've never actually gotten very far into it.   I recently installed 2Gigs in my macbook, and all that extra ram has been burning a hole in my laptop.  So I decided to try out <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual Box</a> and Ubuntu.  It didn't <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-612790.html">work perfectly</a> out of the box, but with a few adjustments, it now works perfectly.</br>
