title: 'David Byrne on Music'

You know, I buy <a href="http://www.wired.com">Wired Magazine</a> whenever I get the chance.  I seek it out at newsstands, and I often wonder why, especially after the last few years, but the last few issues have been good reads again, and anyone who will pay David Byrne to write a long essay on the business of music deserves my cold hard cash.<br /><br />A few choice bits from <a href="http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/magazine/16-01/ff_byrne?currentPage=5">David Byrne's Survival Strategies for Emerging Artists — and Megastars</a> <br /><br /><blockquote>(Calling the product [the record companies sell] music is like selling a shopping cart and calling it groceries.)<br /><blockquote></blockquote>In the past, music was something you heard and experienced — it was <br />as much a social event as a purely musical one. Before recording<br />technology existed, you could not separate music from its<br />social context. Epic songs and ballads, troubadours, courtly<br />entertainments, church music, shamanic chants, pub sing-alongs,<br />ceremonial music, military music, dance music — it was pretty much all<br />tied to specific social functions. It was communal and often<br />utilitarian. You couldn't take it home, copy it, sell it as a commodity<br />(except as sheet music, but that's not music), or even hear it again.<br />Music was an experience, intimately married to your life. You could pay<br />to hear music, but after you did, it was over, gone — a memory.<br /><br /><br /><br />Technology changed all that in the 20th century. Music — or its<br />recorded artifact, at least — became a product, a thing that could be<br />bought, sold, traded, and replayed endlessly in any context. This<br />upended the economics of music, but our human instincts remained<br />intact. I spend plenty of time with buds in my ears listening to<br />recorded music, but I still get out to stand in a crowd with an<br />audience. I sing to myself, and, yes, I play an instrument (not always<br />well).<br /><br /><br /><br />We'll always want to use music as part of our social fabric: to<br />congregate at concerts and in bars, even if the sound sucks; to pass<br />music from hand to hand (or via the Internet) as a form of social<br />currency; to build temples where only "our kind of people" can hear<br />music (opera houses and symphony halls); to want to know more about our<br />favorite bards — their love lives, their clothes, their political<br />beliefs. This betrays an eternal urge to have a larger context beyond a<br />piece of plastic. One might say this urge is part of our genetic makeup.</blockquote>&nbsp;<br /><p></p><blockquote>Ultimately, all these scenarios have to satisfy the same human
urges: What do we need music to do? How do we visit the land in our
head and the place in our heart that music takes us to? Can I get a
round-trip ticket?

<br /><br />Really, isn't that what we want to buy, sell, trade, or download?</blockquote><p> </p><br /><a href="http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/magazine/16-01/ff_byrne?currentPage=5">David Byrne's Survival Strategies for Emerging Artists — and Megastars</a> <br /> <br />
