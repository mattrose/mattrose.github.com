Ted has been secondarying my mail for me for almost as long as the folkwolf has been around, it's a great service when the folkwolf becomes unavailable, as mail queues up on his machine.</br>
</br>
So if you get spam, and you happen to see headers that say it was relayed by bombshelter.ca, PLEASE don't report it to rogers, because it gets him in shit.</br>

I'm sorry, I'm not sure what to do.  Tell rogers that as the postmaster of</br>
folkwolf.net, I agreed to accept any mail that you relay to me as my</br>
secondary, and I'll tell my users that your mail server is supposed to</br>
relay mail to me, and not to bitch to rogers if they see your mail server</br>
in the header path.</br>
