title: 'The ride to conquer cancer continues'
---
I have great news,  Liz and I are going to be riding after all.  200km from Toronto to Niagara Falls this Saturday and Sunday.</br>
</br>
How can this be you ask, have you met your fund-raising totals?  Well we have not yet met the $2500 we are required to raise but we have received and extension and therefore we can ride!</br>
</br>
It was the fantastic financial and emotional support, we have received throughout this adventure which had allowed our continued commitment.</br>
</br>
For those of you who have donated thank you very much, I appreciate it and am overwhelmed by individuals generosity.</br>
</br>
For those of you who are considering a donation, let me reiterate that the money goes to the Princess Margaret Hospital, one of the leading cancer fighting hospital in Canada.</br>
