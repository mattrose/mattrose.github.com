title: 'first long ride'
---
I did my first long bike ride of the season.  My lungs are killing me, but other than that, I feel surprisingly OK.  Details are below.  I've taken to using my iphone and imapmyride to map my rides, and it's actually pretty handy, also, it lets me embed my training rides for everyone on the internets to make fun of.
