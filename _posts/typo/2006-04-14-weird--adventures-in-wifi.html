title: 'Weird  Adventures in WiFi'
---
As I type this, there are 5 wifi networks within my reach, and I've never figured out how to get the Airport software on my mac to use just my connection if it's available, so I often log onto one of my neighbors networks by mistake.  I guess that happened to me this morning.  I turned on iTunes this morning to listen to some music, and I noticed a weird drive in my iTunes sidebar called "Brendan Waddell's LimeWire"  So I looked at this drive, and there was some really great music on this drive.  I was listening to Xavier Rudd earlier (I caught his set at the BluesFest last summer), and now I'm listening to The Curious George soundtrack from Jack Johnson.  Brendan, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the tunes!  I gotta go out and buy a few new CDs.
