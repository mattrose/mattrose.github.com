Remember kids, the idea of folkwolf.net support is laughable in itself, the idea of there being a support TEAM at folkwolf is inconceivable.  Therefore, any messages that purport to come from the folkwolf.net support team are viruses and will do horrible nasty things to your computer if you open it.  If a message doesn't come from me or chris, then you can feel free to ignore it.  Most general info will go up here.
