<br />I just posted this on the Well, after someone else pointed out <a href="" http:="" www.canada.com="" ottawacitizen="" views="" story.html?id="791ff590-40cf-494d-8a94-6ed7548c0ce7&amp;p=2&quot;"> this column</a> by one of the columnists in the local paper<br /><br />&nbsp;Denley's column is the same old crap the crotchety old fucker is<br />&nbsp;always spouting off.&nbsp; I can't believe the Citizen pays a columnist who has<br />&nbsp;just noticed that the housing market in Florida is screwed, only after<br />&nbsp;he's had the fact shoved in his face by actually going there.<br /><br />&nbsp;Then, to top it all off, the smug, pompous git has this to say as a<br />&nbsp;closer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; All of that makes one appreciate Canada more. We have a federal<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; government in surplus, universal health coverage and a stable housing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; market. Those are all things Americans can only dream about.<br /><br />&nbsp;Yeah, 'cause everything is just fucking GREAT up here.&nbsp; That's why the TSX<br />&nbsp;is down 10% over the past week, and the RIM-jobbers in my building are all<br />&nbsp;pissed off 'cause their stock is down 50% from last monday.&nbsp; Just keep<br />&nbsp;whistling past that graveyard, fucker.<br />
