title: 'Two Poems about War'
---
Monday was Memorial Day, so my American friends were talking about war, and the commemoration of it.  </br>
</br>
Two Poems, one familiar, one not.  You can tell from reading them why the latter is unfamiliar, it's as dense as a black-hole, but packs way more of a wallop than the sing-songy first poem.</br>

By: Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae, MD (1872-1918) </br>
Canadian Army</br>
<pre></br>
In Flanders Fields the poppies blow </br>
Between the crosses row on row, </br>
That mark our place; and in the sky </br>
The larks, still bravely singing, fly </br>
Scarce heard amid the guns below.</br>
</br>
We are the Dead. Short days ago </br>
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, </br>
Loved and were loved, and now we lie </br>
In Flanders fields.</br>
</br>
Take up our quarrel with the foe: </br>
To you from failing hands we throw </br>
The torch; be yours to hold it high. </br>
If ye break faith with us who die </br>
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow </br>
In Flanders fields.</br>

</br>
<pre></br>
Under the parabola of a ball,</br>
a child turning into a man,</br>
I looked into the air too long.</br>
The ball fell in my hand, it sang</br>
in the closed fist: Open Open</br>
Behold a gift designed to kill.</br>
</br>
Now in my dial of glass appears </br>
the soldier who is going to die.</br>
He smiles, and moves about in ways</br>
his mother knows, habits of his.</br>
The wires touch his face: I cry</br>
Now. Death, like a familiar, hears</br>
</br>
and look, has made a man of dust</br>
of a man of flesh. This sorcery</br>
I do. Being damned, I am amused</br>
to see the centre of love diffused</br>
and the waves of love travel into vacancy.</br>
How easy it is to make a ghost.</br>
</br>
The weightless mosquito touches</br>
Her tiny shadow on the stone,</br>
and with how like, how infinite</br>
a lightness, man and shadow meet.</br>
They fuse. A shadow is a man</br>
when the mosquito death approaches.</br>
