title: 'Cory Doctorow kicks all kinda ass!'
---
The man is a writing machine.  he once outlined his publishing schedule, and he's publishing about 5  books over the next  couple of years.  He's just published his second novel, and he's made it available for free over the internet.  He explains why <a href="http://craphound.com/est/000041.html">here.</a>  I've reproduced it below.  It's a very lucid and well-thought out argument for him to put stuff out there for free.  

I've also mirrored <a href="http://craphound.com/est/">the book</a> right <a href="http://www.folkwolf.net/~mattrose/Cory_Doctorow_-_Eastern_Standard_Tribe.html">here</a>
