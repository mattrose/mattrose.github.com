title: 'They Fight Crime is back!'
---
<br />Sinisa at work was asking me how I got my signature.&nbsp; So I explained to him about how I originally found it, but the site was, alas, no more.<br /><br />So on a chance, I went looking for it and found this<a href="http://ala.sda.ir/index.php?s=fight+crime"> "ala.sda.ir</a>"&nbsp; So go, and fight crime at<br /><br /><a href="http://www.theyfightcrime.org/">They Fight Crime!</a><br /><br />It's still sheer genius, and I laugh a little every time I write an email.&nbsp; It looks like they may have added content, but they don't display all the content in the view source any more, so I may have to ask them if I can get the newest version.<br />
