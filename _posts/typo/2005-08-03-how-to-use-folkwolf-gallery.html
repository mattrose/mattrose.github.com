title: 'How to use Folkwolf Gallery'

I've upgraded Gallery to the latest version, and I still haven't finished playing with it, but it does have an option for registering yourself, so that if you want to add an album, you can register for your own account.   It'll create an account for you automagically, after that, you can login and create new galleries.  If you want access to edit your existing albums, you can email me and I'll reset the permissions once you get a new account.
