title: 'How Wall Street affects Main Street'

<p>Let's turn around and assume pure motives for all the actors in the drama <br /></br>
&nbsp;that has become the US economy, rather than just spout slogans about <br /></br>
&nbsp;&quot;Greedy Banksters&quot;&nbsp; <br /></br>
&nbsp;<br /></br>
&nbsp;Put yourself in a bank's shoes for a second.&nbsp; If I buy a house, and get a<br /></br>
&nbsp;mortgage from you, you effectively have a house.&nbsp; You let me live there<br /></br>
&nbsp;and pay insurance and taxes on it, but the house is pretty much yours.&nbsp; <br /></br>
&nbsp;Now, several hundred of my friends buy houses, and get their mortgage from<br /></br>
&nbsp;you.&nbsp; Now you own several hundred houses, but you're a bank, and have no<br /></br>
&nbsp;use for several hundred houses.&nbsp; <br /></br>
&nbsp;<br /></br>
&nbsp;Now the factory that employs 1/2 the workers in your small town comes to <br /></br>
&nbsp;you and says &quot;Our equipment is all falling apart, and we could make more <br /></br>
&nbsp;money and hire more workers if you lend us 200 million dollars to retool <br /></br>
&nbsp;the factory&quot;.&nbsp; You'd love to lend them the 200 mil, but all you have is a <br /></br>
&nbsp;bunch of houses.&nbsp; You think &quot;these houses are worth money, but there's no <br /></br>
&nbsp;way to turn those houses into money&quot;<br /></br>
&nbsp;<br /></br>
&nbsp;Then along comes Big NY Investment Bank, and they say &quot;We will give you <br /></br>
&nbsp;money for the houses that you have&quot; and it's the perfect solution.&nbsp; You <br /></br>
&nbsp;get money for your houses, which weren't doing that much for you in the <br /></br>
&nbsp;first place, and you can turn around and lend that money to the factory.<br /></br>
&nbsp;<br /></br>
&nbsp;The failure was not that they weren't investing money in real stuff, they<br /></br>
&nbsp;were just doing it poorly.&nbsp; Very poorly in fact.&nbsp; <br /></br>
&nbsp;<br /></br>
&nbsp;If everybody had been able to pay off their NINA loans, and housing prices<br /></br>
&nbsp;had flattened rather than cratered, then there would have been a slight<br /></br>
&nbsp;contraction, and everybody would continue on.<br /></br>
&nbsp;<br /></br>
&nbsp;At their heart, the goals behind CDOs are actually good goals.&nbsp; They take<br /></br>
&nbsp;a pretty solid asset, and let the investment banks turn that asset into a<br /></br>
&nbsp;more liquid form so they can use the asset to lend money to other people <br /></br>
&nbsp;and businesses, so that they can build factories, or hire more people.<br /></br>
&nbsp;<br /></br>
&nbsp;But, they failed.&nbsp; The fact that they're still in business is a little<br /></br>
&nbsp;puzzling to me, but they kinda have the entire US economy over a barrel,<br /></br>
&nbsp;so I think some people let this one slide, while they figure out how to <br /></br>
&nbsp;fix the big problem, which is that the US economy has become far too <br /></br>
&nbsp;dependent on credit for day-to-day activities, and if that falls apart, <br /></br>
&nbsp;then a lot of shit goes down with it.<br /></br>
&nbsp;<br /></br>
&nbsp;Having said all that, there was a lot of shit that happened, that should <br /></br>
&nbsp;have been regulated, that shouldn't have happened, that was downright <br /></br>
&nbsp;criminal, or should be, but just because the tools didn't work in this one <br /></br>
&nbsp;instance doesn't mean we should throw the tool out.&nbsp; We should just fix <br /></br>
&nbsp;it.<br /></br>
&nbsp;</p></br>
<p>The stock market used to be a much more concrete indicator, back when stocks<br /></br>
paid dividends.&nbsp; Back then, you would buy 200 shares of GE, not so that you <br /></br>
could turn around and sell them for more money later, but because GE would&nbsp; <br /></br>
pay out annual or quarterly dividends to it's stockholders, and if you got&nbsp; <br /></br>
any money on top of that from selling a share, that was a bonus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></br>
<br /></br>
Nowadays, you &quot;Buy Low, Sell High&quot;.&nbsp; So you buy a share not on the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></br>
expectation of a steady return over time, but because you think a share is&nbsp; <br /></br>
under-valued.&nbsp; You're betting on the fact that the company will make more&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></br>
money next quarter, or next year, than it is now.&nbsp; A year ago, everyone was <br /></br>
pretty sure that the next year (ie: the year that just passed) was going to <br /></br>
be pretty crappy for pretty much every company.&nbsp; They were right.&nbsp; Now it&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></br>
seems a lot of people are betting that companies are going to make more&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></br>
money than they did last year (which is actually not that bad a bet,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></br>
considering how bad the last year was).&nbsp; So they invest in stocks that they <br /></br>
think will go up.<br /></br>
<br /></br>
This has the effect of putting more money into companies so that they can&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></br>
turn around and expand, and hire more people.<br /></br>
