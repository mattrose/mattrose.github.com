I especially like this paragraph.</br>
<blockquote></br>
For all its vaunted human rights record, Canada has done precious little to help torture its citizens on behalf of the United States government; indeed, it has opposed this critical counterterrorist measure at every turn. Likewise, despite Sweden's remarkably open society, the Scandanavian nation hasn't turned a single thumbscrew in the struggle against our Islamist enemy. Why, next to stalwarts like Pakistan, Egypt, and Jordan, France is a veritable red flag for regime change! Until the Bush administration starts getting serious with dirty-fingered allies in the anti-freedom axis like Germany, Luxembourg, and Holland, how can its message of freedom be taken seriously at all?</blockquote>
