title: 'My guitar on the radio'
---
Through a weird twist of fate, my guitar, a beautiful parlour-size <a href="http://www.artandlutherieguitars.com/intro.htm">Art&Lutherie</a> that Liz, [update:  Jamie pointed out, rightfully, that he and Joachim and Sue also pitched in for it.  I thank all of them] bought me for my birthday, is going to be on the <a href="http://www.ckcufm.com/">radio</a> today.  When I moved my guitar into the house, <a href="\http://www.kelprecords.com/bands/av/index.html">AV</a> started picking it up and playing it, just while he was watching TV.  Which is pretty much what I do with it, and what I wanted it for.  It's got a really sweet sound to it, and it's just very user-friendly.  He has an appearance from 2:30 - 3:00 pm this aft on CKCU.
