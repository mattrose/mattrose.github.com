title: 'A brief history of the US Credit Crisis.'
---
<a href="http://alsoatalker.blogspot.com/">Another blogger and friend</a> is obsessed with the NPR program, <strong>this american life</strong>, she does a lot of driving in the course of her workday, and she loads it up to listen to while driving around.  I don't drive around that much, so I don't actually get to listen to long-form radio shows that often, but someone on the well pointed out these two episodes of the show, that listened to in the right order (I listened to them in the wrong order) basically lay out in a very compelling narrative, the last 6 months, what led up to the global credit crisis, and how we got to where we are today.

This episode, <a href="http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=355">"The Global Pool of Money"</a>, aired in May, and actually sugues nicely into the episode that was just recorded last week, called "<a href="http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1263">Another Frightening Show About the Economy"</a>
