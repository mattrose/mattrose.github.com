I came accross this snippet on the WeLL just now, and I'm like "Wow, that's kind of funny, I wonder who wrote that?"&nbsp; Turns out it was me.<br /><br /><blockquote>Topic&nbsp; 19 [yahoo.ind]:&nbsp; Questions for Yahoo! Experts!<br />#24 of 25: shillin' thru my pseud: g opensource.ind (mattrose)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fri Mar 24 '06 (07:33)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 lines<br /><br />&nbsp;You're absolutely right, that would violate the holy doctrine of<br />&nbsp;Transboingification.&nbsp; The process where a post on boingboing<br />&nbsp;*becomes* truth through the power of boing.<br /></blockquote>I really do like that.&nbsp; I think just because I like the word transboingification<br />
