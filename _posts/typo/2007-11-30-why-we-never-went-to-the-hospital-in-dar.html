The procedure was performed two weeks later than planned because when he was originally due for brain surgery doctors erroneously performed a knee operation, the BBC reported.

<br />Meanwhile, Emmanuel Didas -- who underwent brain surgery even though he had been hospitalized for a knee problem -- was recovering but partially paralyzed, the British broadcaster said. Didas cannot move his right side following the operation on his brain. </blockquote>
