title: 'meditations on terrorism'

I'm sitting here listening to Buck 65, Riverbed part 4.  It's an oddly hypnotic song that goes along with a blog entry from one of the Gnome developers.</br>
</br>
<blockquote></br>
Our might does not make right. Our present and historical invovlement in the mideast is conveniently unknown or forgotten. Effects and causes are disjoint. The West Wing's Toby Ziegler might be right - maybe they will like us when we win. But maybe they'll like us if we simply stop doing everything within our power to fuck with their lives. There's a good New Testament quote to the effect of "they will know you are a Christian through your actions and good deeds." Let's spread freedom through our good example instead of our tanks.   </br>

Maybe we need a more Buddhist, kung-fu style approach to the War on Terror.  I don't understand how we can win a War on Terror, when our enemies are ourselves.  They could be our friends, our neighbours, or they could be people a million miles away.  Terrorists are our enemies, but how can you tell a terrorist?  They don't wear uniforms, they're not all one colour,creed, or race.  They could be our friends, our neighbours, or they could be people a million miles away.  There's now way we can tell them apart, there's no way we can fight the terrorists without fighting ourselves as well. As soon as you declare a War on Terrorists, you're declaring a war on the whole population.  So what to do?  We can't lock everyone up who looks at us funny, try as we might, maybe the only way to end the War on Terror is to follow the teachings of the Buddha.</br>

<blockquote></br>
 "Everyone fears punishment," he says, "everyone fears death, just as you do. Therefore do not kill or cause to kill. Everyone fears punishment; everyone loves life, as you do. Therefore do not kill or cause to kill." He also said, "Hatred cannot put an end to hatred; love alone can. This is an unalterable law."</br>
</blockquote></br>
</br>
Or Jesus, as he said in the Sermon on the Mount:</br>
<blockquote></br>
"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say to you, Do not resist one who is evil. But if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also; and if any one would sue you and take your coat, let him have your cloak as well; and if any one forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to him who begs from you, and do not refuse him who would borrow from you. You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven.  <br /><i>Matthew, Chapter 5, verses 35 - 44</i></br>
