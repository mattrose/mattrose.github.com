title: 'Changes coming to the folkwolf'
---
I've been wanting to upgrade the folkwolf, this humble server that I've had for over 10 years now.  As some of you may know, and our motd attests to, reliability ain't been a hallmark.</br>
</br>
This has been for a few reasons.</br>
</br>
1.  It's sitting on a home DSL connection.</br>
2. It's on an ancient 500MHz machine, with 512 MB of RAM.  Fercrissake the iphone has a faster CPU than the folkwolf does...</br>
3. I think the disk is starting to go.</br>
</br>
So last week, after a friend of mine on the well made up <a href="http://blog.jeffreymcmanus.com/1403/comparitive-pricing-for-virtual-hosting-providers/">this chart</a>, I bit the bullet and signed up for <a href="http://www.rackspacecloud.com/">Rackspace Cloud"</a>.  Rackspace Cloud is a nifty service that will let you run a Virtual Server in their datacenter.  For 1.5c / hr,  It'll cost me ~ $11/mo to run the folkwolf, which, really, is about the same as I pay for it having it sit under my desk.  As pros for this, a better, more reliable connection, free snapshot backups, and an upgraded OS (CentOS 5, rather than the woefully out of date version of Fedora that's currently there)
