I seem to be in funny list mode.   In the spirit of 5ives, and 213 Skippy isn't allowed to do, I give you:  <a href="http://badnewshughes.blogspot.com/2004_01_01_badnewshughes_archive.html#107541745599672714">Uncle Patrickâ€™s Advice to Children</a> From <a href="http://badnewshughes.blogspot.com">Bad News Hughes</a>; striving to find a way to punch people in the face by using the Internet.
