The evening I posted the last entry, the entry about elephants, I happened to watch <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/">the nature of things</a>.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/gameover.html">documentary</a> was about the mixed history of conservation in Kenya.&nbsp; The two prominent figures in it were, of course, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Leakey">Richard Leakey</a>.&nbsp; The other one was <a href="http://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/index.asp">Daphne Sheldrick</a>.<br />
