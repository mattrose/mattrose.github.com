Some people have decided we need a new SF movement.  The last one was Cyberpunk, and some of the latest tomes of SF have been lumped into a movement called "Slipstream" Which Meghan McCarron Calls <a href="http://www.chrononaut.org/log/archives/000547.html#4942">wussy</a>.</br>
</br>
So a bunch of people have come up with "Infernokrusher"  SF, with catchphrases such as:</br>
</br>
<ul></br>
<li>Core Infernokrusher fiction would never forget to fill up the tank. Infernokrusher is always intense.</br>
</li><li>More than the death of the Reader, Infernokrusher prizes the sudden, violent dismemberment of the Reader </br>
</li><li>Infernokrusher fiction explodes stagnant genre conventions, e.g., that its not okay to have all your characters run over by a monster truck in what would seem to be the middle of the story</br>
</li><li> Infernokrusher is a violently anti-materialist movement, regardless of the materials involved</br>
</li><li> While other attitudes to art yearn to communicate truths, to move people, to challenge, or to entertain, infernokrusher art wants to blow stuff up</br>
</li></ul>
