<p>Every time you get in a car, you are handling a lethal weapon.&#160; If you do not do so with the utmost care, <a href="http://bicycling.com/blogs/roadrights/2009/11/18/traffic-injustice/">someone could die</a>.&#160; </p>  <p>Pedestrians and cyclists don’t have a “safety cage” around them, like all modern cars do.&#160; Pedestrians are separated by a kerb.&#160; Cyclists are required by law to share the road with people like the ones mentioned in the article above.&#160; Even at a low speed, cars can and have killed cyclists.&#160; Wearing helmets, and safety gear, even in a bike lane.&#160; To a motorist, an accident is an inconvenience, 99.9% of the time, they have to repair their car, at worst.&#160; To cyclists, any collision with a car has a very good chance of death.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Think about that next time you see a cyclist…</p>
