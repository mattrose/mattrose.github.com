this is a little snippet I wrote to monitor the bugzilla server at work, and put a tray icon in my GNOME panel to tell me that there is a bug in the queue.</br>
</br>
the code is below.  there's probably some wordwrap issues.</br>
</br>
The huge todo list.</br>
Properly deal with when someone reassigns a bug out of the queue, and kill the notification.</br>
properly background the process, so that I can just run it out of the gnome session manager.</br>
have the ability to configure the icon</br>
have the ability to pass in the filename containing the url on the command line, or pass in the url on the command line.</br>
Later on:</br>
Properly deal with more than one entry in the queue, and print out a list of bugnumbers and summaries.  I already set up the dictionary to do this right, but I can't figure out what to do with it.  I probably should look at porting libnotify to python, if no-one else has.</br>
