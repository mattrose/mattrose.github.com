title: 'Folkwolf mail is down (on purpose this time)'
---
I've moved mail (sending and receiving) over to the new fancy colo'ed server.  Right now, if you're impatient and have to get mail *now*, you'll have to repoint your mail client to calcata.folkwolf.net  As usual, support is, leave a comment or send me a message somehow, and I'll try and help you through it if you need help.  </br>
</br>
If mail works well over the next day or so, everything will be moving over there, and I'll point all of the dns over there, and you won't have to do anything.</br>
