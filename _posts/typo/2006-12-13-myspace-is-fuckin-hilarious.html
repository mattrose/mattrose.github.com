<br />A friend of mine <a href="http://www.kelprecords.com/bands/av/index.htm">AV</a> just recently wrote a song for an <a href="http://www.oldnavy.com/customerService/info.do?cid=3152">old navy ad</a>, you may recognize it if you've been near a TV lately.&nbsp; So for some reason I was hunting around on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/avandthepirates">www.myspace.com/avandthepirates</a> and, if you read the comments in chronological order, it starts out with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/flectonbigsky">Mich</a>, and <a href="http://www.howietsui.com/">Howie</a>, and a whole bunch of AVs actual friends, and then you can tell when the ad comes out because it's full of<br /><br />"<small>that would be fantaastiiiic &lt;333"</small><br /><br />and <br /><br />"<big>OMG I LOVE YOU</big>
"<br /><br />comments.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love that AV is getting the exposure, and it's great that so many people are realizing he's a fucking genius, but reading those comments just cracked me up.<br /><br />Also, that "snow shake" song has two verses.&nbsp; Who knew?<br /><br />
