 I'm posting this from my Dad's MacBook via Writely.  I took some pictures using the Built in camera, and Photo Booth, and I played around with iWeb to help my dad.  Aside from really only being able to plug into the .mac stuff, it's actually quite nice, and you can publish to a folder, and then upload the folder.<br>
