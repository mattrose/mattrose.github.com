From an <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/tom-waits/article1407145/">interview</a> with the Globe and Mail:</br>
</br>
<blockquote>But people hear music in all kinds of different ways. Some people experience music as colours; others just see grey water pouring out of the speakers. Some never listen to lyrics, they just fall under a spell. Some eat it whole. Some just take a bite. Some of us like to get on our backs and roll around in it like a dog. </blockquote>
