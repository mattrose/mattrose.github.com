title: 'Sister Machine Gun.'

<a href="http://www.jwz.org/gruntle">JWZ</a> is one of the few people in the world who know a lot about computers and the internet, and "Content"  He missed out on Linux, but that's OK, we love him anyway.  He runs a nightclub now in the SOMA neighbourhood of SF.  It's a v. cool place, and he REALLY tries to hype local musicians, and music he likes.  It's not much of the music I like (More like the music Gorester likes) but anyone who's willing to go out on a limb like he did deserves many kudos.  </br>

The preceding paragraph is entirely beside the point, which is about the music industry, a subject I'm very interested in for many reasons, two of the biggest are <a href="http://www.banditas.ca">my girlfriend</a> and <a href="http://www.kelprecords.com/bands/av">my room-mate</a>.  The record industry is in a fucked up state right now, and nothing displays that more humourously than this quote that JWZ heard Sister Machine Gun say on <a href="http://www.dnalounge.com">his stage</a></br>
