title: 'Removed a bunch of web apps'
---
I removed a bunch of php web applications into an archive on the folkwolf, and removed their permissions.  There's a <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/New-Worm-Exploits-Linux-Vulnerabilities-11896.shtml&cid=1102259967">worm </a> going around that exploits <a href="http://www.php.net">php</a> code.  Most of the applications that I run on the folkwolf are php apps, and there was a lot of dead weight lying around, and I didn't feel like auditing all that code, so I just removed all the stuff that I don't use.  If anyone wants anything back, lemme know
