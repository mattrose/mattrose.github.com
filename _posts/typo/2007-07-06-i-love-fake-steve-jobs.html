<br />He actually really pins the nail on the head with this one<br /><br /><a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2007/07/music-industry-nobs-have-finally.html">The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs: The music industry nobs have finally figured out what we're doing</a><br /><br /><blockquote>Here's the thing. These guys could have done what we did. In the early</br>
days of the Internet, everyone figured the majors would build digital</br>
distribution arms. But they didn't do it, because they didn't</br>
understand technology, and they didn't want to invest in building this</br>
expertise, and they were freaked out about piracy and paralyzed with</br>
fear. So we stepped in. We made the big investment. We hired</br>
programmers. We developed software that's easy to use and works</br>
flawlessly. (If you think that's trivial, think again. It's huge.) We</br>
ran the system. We promoted it, we marketed it, we haggled with all the</br>
majors and struck deals. We took all the risk, which was considerable.</br>
Now we're reaping the reward. And the majors want a bigger slice. Um,</br>
for what? We did all the work. Ain't gonna happen, slick.</blockquote></br>
