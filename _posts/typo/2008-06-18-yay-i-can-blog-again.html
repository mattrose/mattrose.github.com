title: 'Yay, I can blog again!'
---
I always blog sporadically, I know, but I've been blogging even more sporadically than usual, because my <a href="http://www.scribefire.com/">usual blogging software</a> stopped working with my blog.  I tried to use  <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a>'s blogging plugin to blog, but that didn't work either
So when I heard that MarsEdit released a new version.  I went out (virtually), to <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/>Red Sweater Software</a> and took <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> for a spin. And it works.  If you're quick you can still see my test post.
