title: 'Matts obsession with US politics, part IV, subsection 3'
---
I was up late (or early, actually I had slept earlier that night) at Burning Man, guarding the temple of Hope and Fear.&nbsp; The guys from Disorient had brought out their bus with the Massive PA system, and there was a rave going on all night behind us.&nbsp; In the middle of it, I heard <a href="http://blog.folkwolf.net/files/03_Not_In_Our_Name.mp3">this tune</a>, which was remixed from <a href="http://blog.folkwolf.net/files/Def_Poetry_Jam_-_Saul_Williams_-_Not_in_Our_Name.mp3">this poem</a>.<br /><br />What brought it all back, in a weird way, was this "remix" of the tired "Neville Chamberlain" appeasement argument, where American columnist Keith Olbermann, turns the argument on its head in a quite brilliant manner.<br />&nbsp;<a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2006/08/30/keith-olbermann-delivers-one-hell-of-a-commentary-on-rumsfeld/">http://www.crooksandliars.com/2006/08/30/keith-olbermann-delivers-one-hell-of-a-commentary-on-rumsfeld/</a>
