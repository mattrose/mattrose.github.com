I've been vaguely following the story of what Canada's been doing to help with the situation in the Darfur region of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/sudan/default.stm>Sudan</a>.  Mom was posted there with the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/">Red Cross</a>, and also the story of <a href="http://www.david-kilgour.com/">David Kilgour</a> who insisted that Canada send troops to Darfur, when the Sudanese gov't wouldn't let them in.  The compromise that was come up with was that Canada would send APC's for the AU troops to use.  The Sudanese gov't wouldn't even let those in, and there's been constant stories in the Canadian news on how these APC's were languishing in West Africa doing nothing.  Then I read <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4441996.stm">this story</a> about the Sudanese gov't finally allowing the APC's in.  But I only found out by reading the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/default.stm">BBC Africa</a> website.
