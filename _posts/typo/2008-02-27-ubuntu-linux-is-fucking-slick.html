title: 'Ubuntu Linux is fucking slick'
---
 I finally got a new computer at work here, and after hearing about Ubuntu</br>
 for years, I decided to take the plunge.  I installed ubuntu.</br>
 </br>
 I have to admit, I am impressed.  I spent years getting my old Fedora Core</br>
 5 Desktop up to a point where it was comfortable, and functional.  It fit</br>
 me like an old skin.  I think I compiled most of the GUI myself, and</br>
 tweaked it to my satisfaction.  It was at least hundreds of hours of</br>
 effort.</br>
 </br>
 Ubuntu is better.  I know what I'm doing, but Ubuntu is so fucking slick.</br>
 </br>
 Every little thing, Like the multimedia keys on my fancy-dancy MS keyboard </br>
 that I got working after a few hours of futzing about.   On ubuntu, they </br>
 worked perfectly.  Fonts look nice, for the first time *ever* in Linux, </br>
 and they look nice with the change of one radio button.  My music player </br>
 displays the song name.  Evolution notifies me of new emails seamlessly, </br>
 and unobtrusively.  OpenOffice works great out of the box.  VMWare works </br>
 great out of the box.  My fancy 22" widescreen works better than it does </br>
 in XP.  I could go on and on.</br>
 </br>
 Give it a couple of years, it'll give Mac a run for it's money UI-wise.</br>
 In some ways it's already better.</br>
 </br>
 </br>
 What I find most impressive is the Ubuntu Forums.  Most problems are</br>
 solved by the forums at www.ubuntuforums.org, with not only a search</br>
 function that lists really good, relevant results, but if, say, you do a</br>
 search, and don't find anything, and start typing a post to the forum</br>
 titled "X problems with Foo", the forum will look up similar posts.</br>
 </br>
 I know this is way late, and I'm getting on this bus near the last stop,</br>
 but I've been thinking about these problems for a long time.  I've been a</br>
 Linux User for more than 10 years now, I've seen Linux run on just about </br>
 every piece of hardware known to man.  I've supported Linux for more than </br>
 5 years, and I've developed Linux (not the kernel, just a distro) for more </br>
 than 3 now.  They really have solved every problem.  Now it's just a </br>
 matter of traction and mindshare.</br>
