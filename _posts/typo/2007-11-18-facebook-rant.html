I have interesting, intelligent friends.  I swear I do.  Unfortunately, you would never know it by the stupid crap that I get sent on facebook.   </br>
</br>
People publishing rehashed insipid email memes from the 80s as notes, People sending stupid apps.  No, I don't want to be a Vampire, Zombie, or get sent a goddamn sprite sip (This one hasn't happened yet, but...)</br>
</br>
"Friends" spamming my FunWall with the latest stupid video.</br>
</br>
My friends aren't goddamn sheep, but you would never know it by facebook.</br>
