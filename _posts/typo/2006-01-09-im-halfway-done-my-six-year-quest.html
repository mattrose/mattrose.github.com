Back in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991008095256/http://www.folkwolf.net/">1999</a>  I told people that I was coming out with an e-commerce strategy <a href="http://www.hacker-dictionary.com/terms/Real%20Soon%20Now">RSN</a>.  Well, 6 years later, my plan has come to fruition.  See if you can spot the change.</br>

My Web Community strategy came and went a little while ago, but I'm planning for Community3.0, due out RSN.  Meaning, probably another 6 years.
