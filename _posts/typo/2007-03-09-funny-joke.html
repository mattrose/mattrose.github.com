Found on the WeLL, filed under the lighter side of terrorism<br /><br />&nbsp;The coach had put together the perfect team for the Oakland Raiders.<br />&nbsp;The only thing missing was a good quarterback. He had scouted all the<br />&nbsp;colleges and even the Canadian and European Leagues, but he couldn't<br />&nbsp;find a ringer who could ensure a Super Bowl victory.<br /><br />&nbsp; Then one night, while watching CNN, he saw a war-zone scene in<br />&nbsp;Afghanistan. In one corner of the background, he spotted a young Afghan<br />&nbsp;Muslim soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand- grenade<br />&nbsp;straight into a window from 80 yards away. Then he threw another<br />&nbsp;grenade&nbsp; from 50 yards down a chimney, and then hit a passing car going<br />&nbsp;80 miles per hour.<br /><br />&nbsp; ï¿½I've got to get this guy!" coach said to himself. "He has the<br />&nbsp;perfect arm!" So, he brings the young Afghan to the States and teaches<br />&nbsp;him the great game of football ..... and sure enough the Raiders go on<br />&nbsp;to win the Super Bowl.<br /><br />&nbsp; The young Afghan is hailed as a hero of football, and when the Coach<br />&nbsp;asks him what he wants, all the young man wants to do is call his<br />&nbsp;mother.<br /><br />&nbsp; "Mom," he says into the phone, "I just won the Super Bowl!"<br /><br />&nbsp;"I don't want to talk to you," the old Muslim woman says. "You<br />&nbsp;deserted us. You are not my son!"<br /><br />&nbsp;"Mother, I don't think you understand," pleads the son, "I've just won<br />&nbsp;the greatest sporting event in the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;"No! Let me tell you," his mother retorts, "at this very moment there<br />&nbsp;are gunshots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your<br />&nbsp;two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives last week, and I<br />&nbsp;have to keep your sister in the house so she doesn't get assaulted!"<br />&nbsp;The old lady pauses, then tearfully says, "I will never forgive you for<br />&nbsp;making us move to Oakland!"<br /><br />
