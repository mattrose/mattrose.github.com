title: 'How the record companies are out to screw you today'
---
This came across my virtual desk.&nbsp; Thought I'd share.&nbsp; I'll clean it up a bit later.<br /><br />For those playing along at home.&nbsp; The RIAA is the five big record companies.&nbsp; the NMPA is the songwriters and publishers.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&gt; FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:<br />&nbsp;&gt;<br />&nbsp;&gt; On Monday, January 28, the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) begins the<br />&nbsp;&gt; hearing that will determine mechanical rates for every songwriter<br />&nbsp;and<br />&nbsp;&gt; music publisher in America. It will be the most important rate<br />&nbsp;&gt; hearing in the history of the music industry because in addition to<br />&nbsp;&gt; setting rates for physical products, rates will be set for the first<br />&nbsp;&gt; time ever for digital products such as digital downloads,<br />&nbsp;subscription<br />&nbsp;&gt; services and ringtones.<br />&nbsp;&gt;<br />&nbsp;&gt; The National Music Publishers' Association (NMPA) will be<br />&nbsp;representing<br />&nbsp;&gt; the interests of songwriters and music publishers and will be<br />&nbsp;fighting<br />&nbsp;&gt; vigorously to protect those interests to ensure that musical<br />&nbsp;&gt; compositions are compensated fairly.<br />&nbsp;&gt;<br />&nbsp;&gt; On the other side of this fight stands the Recording Industry<br />&nbsp;&gt; Association of America (RIAA) and the Digital Music Association<br />&nbsp;&gt; (DiMA). Both the RIAA and DiMA have proposed significant reductions<br />&nbsp;&gt; in mechanical royalty rates that would be disastrous for songwriters<br />&nbsp;&gt; and music publishers. This is literally a fight for the survival of<br />&nbsp;&gt; our industry.<br />&nbsp;&gt;<br />&nbsp;&gt; To give you an example of what is at stake, the current rate for<br />&nbsp;&gt; physical phonorecords is 9.1 cents. The NMPA is proposing an<br />&nbsp;increase<br />&nbsp;&gt; to 12.5 cents per song. The RIAA, however, has proposed slashing the<br />&nbsp;&gt; rate to approximately 6 cents a song - a cut of more than one-third<br />&nbsp;&gt; the current rate!<br />&nbsp;&gt;<br />&nbsp;&gt; For permanent digital downloads, NMPA is proposing a rate of 15<br />&nbsp;cents<br />&nbsp;&gt; per track because the costs involved are much less than for physical<br />&nbsp;&gt; products. The RIAA has proposed the outrageous rate of approximately<br />&nbsp;&gt; 5 - 5.5 cents per track, and DiMA is proposing even less.<br />&nbsp;&gt;<br />&nbsp;&gt; If you find that troubling, it gets worse. For interactive streaming<br />&nbsp;&gt; services, which some analysts believe will be the future of the<br />&nbsp;music<br />&nbsp;&gt; industry, NMPA is proposing a rate of the greater of 12.5% of<br />&nbsp;revenue,<br />&nbsp;&gt; 27.5% of content costs, or a micro-penny calculation based on usage.<br />&nbsp;&gt; The RIAA actually proposed that songwriters and music publishers<br />&nbsp;&gt; should get the equivalent of .58% of revenue. This isn't a typo -<br />&nbsp;&gt; less than 1%. And DiMA is taking the shocking and offensive position<br />&nbsp;&gt; that songwriters' and music publishers' mechanical rights should be<br />&nbsp;&gt; zero, because DiMA does not believe we have any such rights!<br />&nbsp;&gt;<br />&nbsp;&gt; The initial hearing will last four weeks, with the three permanent<br />&nbsp;&gt; Copyright Royalty Judges hearing arguments Mondays through Thursdays<br />&nbsp;&gt; from 9:30 am - 4:30 pm each day. At the conclusion of the initial<br />&nbsp;&gt; hearing, there will be more discovery, followed by a rebuttal<br />&nbsp;hearing<br />&nbsp;&gt; in May, and a final decision expected on October 2.<br />&nbsp;&gt;<br />&nbsp;&gt; The NMPA will be spending millions dollars in this proceeding to<br />&nbsp;&gt; protect the interests of songwriters and music publishers against<br />&nbsp;the<br />&nbsp;&gt; much larger record labels and digital media companies. And although<br />&nbsp;&gt; we face such an enormous fight, we have an incredible advantage - we<br />&nbsp;&gt; represent songwriters, without whom the record labels and digital<br />&nbsp;&gt; music services could not exist.<br />&nbsp;&gt;<br />&nbsp;&gt; Please forward this to anyone who is involved in the songwriting and<br />&nbsp;&gt; music publishing industry. We will be sending out regular updates as<br />&nbsp;&gt; the CRB progresses to keep you informed. Through your networks, we<br />&nbsp;&gt; hope to reach the vast majority of the industry. If you did not<br />&nbsp;&gt; receive this directly, and would like to be added to the master NMPA<br />&nbsp;&gt; communications list, please send your contact information to Jamie<br />&nbsp;&gt; Marotta at jmarotta@nmpa.org.<br /><br />
