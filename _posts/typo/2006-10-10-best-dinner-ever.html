title: 'Best dinner ever.'
---
Dad was in town friday and saturday, and when dad said, "is there anywhere outside of town you want to go to for dinner", I immediately thought of <a href="http://www.soupcon.biz/html/welcome.html">Tanya's restaurant</a>.&nbsp; We drove up saturday on back roads through the Gatineau Hills, and ended up in Wakefield, with the sun setting over the Gatineau River.&nbsp; Halfway through the appetizer, the moon rose over the hills and the river, beautifully framed by the window of the restaurant.&nbsp;&nbsp; This isn't a restaurant review, so I won't go over what everyone had, but let me just say that the food was outstanding.&nbsp; We all agreed it was one of the best evenings we ever spent in a restaurant.&nbsp; <br /><br />
