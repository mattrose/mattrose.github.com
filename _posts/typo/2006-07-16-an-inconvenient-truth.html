title: 'An Inconvenient Truth'

I'm probably the last blogger to see this, but I have to say, as well as everyone else.  Go See This Movie.<BR> I originally wrote this in a response to someone on <A HREF=http://www.well.com TITLE="The WeLL">The WeLL</A> over a week ago, before I even saw this movie. <BR> <BR> <BLOCKQUOTE> Global Warming is very alarming.  That's why Al Gore is trying to make people more aware of the problems it will pose.  The "degrees of disagreement" are *tiny*.<BR> <BR> The Global Warming nay-sayers, few as they may be, get an instant megaphone from the oil, and other companies.  These companies make sure that the one study that casts doubt gets more dissemination to the public than the thousand other studies that confirm that global warming is here.<BR> <BR> We will all have to make massive changes in the very near future. Believe it or not, Al Gore is on the side of making a few, relatively benign choices now rather than making the vast, sweeping changes that will be necessary if we do nothing now.<BR> </BLOCKQUOTE><BR> <BR> Here's the next version with edits after seeing the movie.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Global Warming is very alarming.  That's why Al Gore is trying to make people more aware of the problems it will pose.  The "degrees of disagreement" are <SPAN STYLE="FONT-STYLE: italic"><SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">non-existent.</SPAN></SPAN>  In the movie itself the statistic is given that in peer-reviewes scientific journals, 0 out of 962 articles on global warming dispute the scientific basis for global warming.  The popular press had over 50% of more than 600 articles that said that the science of global warming was ambivalent, or wrong.  This is spin and PR on the scale we rarely see, and it's killing the planet.  Anytime you see a study that debates the scientific merit of global warming, you <SPAN STYLE="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-STYLE: italic">know</SPAN> that the study has been paid for by the energy companies, and has been ignored by the scientific community.<BR> <BR>  We will all have to make massive changes in the very near future.<BR>  Believe it or not, Al Gore is on the side of making a few, relatively benign choices now rather than making the vast, sweeping changes that will be necessary if we do nothing now.  Near the end of the movie he outlines 4 or 5 relatively small things that people can do to reduce the CO2 emissions back down to below 1970 levels.  If we do not do these things now, we won't have any easy things to do in the future.<BR> <BR> <BR>
