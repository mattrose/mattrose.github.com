title: 'best.  rant. ever'

This is probably the best straight out rant I've ever read.</br>
read more to check it out.</br>
</br>
for some reason, a long time ago, back when I imported this into WordPress, I lost the original text.  I found it again.  I long ago lost the slashdot URL, but it was by an AC anyway...</br>

 I've been targeted right out of the market.</br>
</br>
 I've had it. I can't take any more advertising. Television, radio,</br>
 magazines, billboards, even the Internet for Christ's sake. Everywhere. Why</br>
 do they keep targeting me? I never did anything to them. I don't even buy</br>
 anything! They're wasting their time! Fast food makes me feel like shit,</br>
 soft drinks make me dizzy, candy is disgusting, chips make my stomach hurt,</br>
 I don't smoke, and any band that has ever been advertised anywhere sucks</br>
 unequivocally. I eat tortillas and vegetables, I drink tap water. I ride my</br>
 $40 bike for entertainment. I buy a new pair of Dickies at the army navy</br>
 store every year and I get all my other clothes at Costco in 3-packs. My car</br>
 works fine, I use my Internet connection for long distance, I've had the</br>
 same boots for three years and re-sole them when they wear out. As far as</br>
 booze goes, well, as long as it's wet&#352;&#352;.</br>
</br>
 So why do they keep attacking me? Why are they filling every square inch of</br>
 every available space in my life? Above urinals, on concert tickets,</br>
 underneath the ice at hockey games, on blimps, in video games, as props in</br>
 movies, plugs in rap songs, on shitty Web Sites (No, I will not visit your</br>
 motherfucking sponsor. If you're not in it for the love, and you can't</br>
 figure out any better way to pay for your site than by slapping some ugly,</br>
 corrupted banner across the top of your pathetic work, then fucking close up</br>
 shop, kill yourself, and leave the Web to non-polluters). They'd advertise</br>
 on the backs of my eyelids if they could get away with it, and I can't hack</br>
 it anymore. They win. I lose. They succeeded. I failed. Like Brian Wilson, I</br>
 just wasn't built for these times. I fold. Here are all my cards. Keep the</br>
 pot, keep my ante, keep the goddamn jacket on the back of my chair for all I</br>
 care, I can get another at Costco. I'll be out in the parking lot getting</br>
 drunk and yelling at cute girls because I can no longer stand the taste of</br>
 tentacles. Marketing has poisoned everything worthwhile under the sun, so</br>
 I'm giving it all up. Everything.</br>
</br>
 But the way I figure it, there's no real loss. I've seen all of the episodes</br>
 of the Simpsons 200 times each. Most of the good writing was done 100 years</br>
 ago. I haven't listened to FM radio in years. I could play all my records</br>
 beginning to end alphabetically and I'd be 76 years old when I got to the</br>
 Zeni Geva. Online culture is a fucking yawn, only good for buying stuffed</br>
 goats on Ebay and getting cracked copies of $1000 software. Movies always</br>
 end up at the 99 cent video store across the street eventually, and you can</br>
 fast forward through those commercials. My girlie's cute and the corner bar</br>
 has Pabst on tap. What else matters?</br>
</br>
 True, by shutting myself off to everything, I'm probably limiting my future</br>
 potential as a 'community building' or 'bleeding edge' cog in someone's</br>
 nightmarish vision of Internet profitability, but fuck, a simple read</br>
 through my writing should've cured that anyway (Note to potential employers:</br>
 The bidding starts at $120,000 a year with full dental).</br>
</br>
 So I'm out. No more.</br>
</br>
 I just feel bad for those of you I'm leaving behind. You'll be wearing your</br>
 Slave Labor Nikes, sweating under a Third World Vest, listening to Everqueer</br>
 or Fratboy Slim, your hair styled stupidly with gasoline and aborted pig</br>
 placentas, trying to choke down a Double Meat Fuck Splattered Cow Testicles</br>
 On The Slaughterhouse Floor Pus Coagulated Lactacious Secretion Yellow Dye</br>
 #2 Deluxe. Man, will you be looking dumb. It makes me want to cry. You poor,</br>
 oversugared demographic you. You're filling your apartments, your bodies,</br>
 and your minds with useless junk. You stagger under your own weight,</br>
 throwing money in random directions until you collapse and die, buried by a</br>
 bunch of people who you failed to create meaningful human bonds with, who</br>
 forget about you on the way home from the funeral.</br>
</br>
 Maybe I'm just oversensitive, but I actually feel those fingers reaching out</br>
 at me - cute little girl fingers, feeling at my face like a bind man,</br>
 pulling at the loose threads all over my brain, trying to find a sensitive</br>
 one, one that tweaks me. Desires to be successful, attractive to the</br>
 opposite sex, spiritually satiated, or conversely, the fears of disease,</br>
 dismemberment, of being outcast, of repressed homosexual desires. Herd</br>
 mentality as dictated by herd mentality. A gas mask of soiled wool, worn in</br>
 a steaming shower of chlorinated pond water. A lumbering culture created by</br>
 profit motive, existing as window dressing to disguise the brutal cynicism</br>
 of the architects, the brassy checks and balances of accountants bleating</br>
 commands to the flunky tastemakers on the production line. The subversion of</br>
 anything subverting. The conversion of something dangerous into something</br>
 profitable. The gutting of the lion and the championing of the taxidermist.</br>
 And the puffy vests, my god, the puffy vests&#352;&#352;..</br>
</br>
 I give it one more shot.</br>
</br>
 I hit that little "on" button, and immediately this little red dot appears</br>
 on my forehead. I feel the barrel rising on the other side of the glass as</br>
 some powersuited executive attempts to get me in his sights. His scope is</br>
 the best money can buy, but my nausea and skittishness mark me as difficult</br>
 prey. I make a sprawling leap over a pile of books, spilling a glass of wine</br>
 and sending my cats scattering. The TV takes a shot at me. It misses, but</br>
 after the smoke clears, there's a shimmering can of Pepsi on the coffee</br>
 table, seductively held by a well manicured (but severed) hand. Then the</br>
 Taco Bell dog is outside, scratching at my window, singing "That's Amore",</br>
 the secret code that alerts Col. Sanders and Ronald McDonald to get their</br>
 tumor inducing grease guns at the ready. "We have a resistor! Alert Cap'n</br>
 Crunch and Mrs. Butterworth. Tell Hogan to pull that Subaru around!" And</br>
 then, as the entire posse of 1-800-COLLECT goons attempt to joke their way</br>
 through the front door, a helmeted uberyouth does a backflip on rollerblades</br>
 against the window, almost crushing the Taco dog, thankfully getting tangled</br>
 in the iron jungle of security bars designed for such a moment. The severed</br>
 Pepsi hand launches itself across the room onto the stereo, turns it to</br>
 HOTROCK 99.5 FM and starts dancing suggestively on the turntable. Warm,</br>
 gooey songs ooze from the speakers, blurring the lines between commercial</br>
 and product, product and art. The walls are running with honey, blood, and</br>
 Gatorade. Limp Bizkit tries to sign me up for the Rap Metal MasterCard, but</br>
 is outvolumed by a chorus of creepy NY Gap models, dead eyed and Children of</br>
 the Damned style, singing nostalgic 80s songs with cool detachment, trying</br>
 to sell me vests. Close inspection reveals UPC codes on the backs of their</br>
 beautiful necks and a legion of bulimic girls behind them, mascara mixing</br>
 with puke on ten thousand toilet bowls. Budweiser frogs are crawling out of</br>
 the toilet bowls. A one-eyed, mutilated Asian girl holds a pair of new</br>
 Levi's against the window with a thin, purple arm and starts screeching</br>
 "It's a Small World After All" at the top of her lungs. Magic, The Old Navy</br>
 dog, is sniffing butts with the Taco Bell dog, who had since bit the Asian</br>
 girl on the leg and now yelling something about Gordidas. A waifish beauty</br>
 suddenly appears on my bed, vying for my attention, trying to talk me into a</br>
 new car, her hand slowly unbuttoning her blouse, batting her doe-ishly brown</br>
 eyes, "C'mon Mark. It's only a test drive. No one ever has to know."</br>
</br>
 Realizing my one escape, I yank my battered wallet out of my back pocket and</br>
 pull out a twenty dollar bill. The entire scene freezes. All eyes are</br>
 transfixed to the damp, smelly piece of paper. Andrew Jackson snickers and</br>
 you can almost smell the cannibalized Indian on his breath. A miraculous</br>
 cross breeze flows through my apartment, and I let the money go. It catches</br>
 an upward draft, a hot air thermal, and is gone out the window.</br>
</br>
 And then, something even stranger happens. The spokespeople, animals,</br>
 models, body parts, and corporate whores all disappear in a anti-climactic</br>
 'puff' of yellow smoke, leaving a slight smell of perfumed intestine</br>
 twisting through the air. My twenty freezes in mid flight about thirty feet</br>
 above the ground. A helicopter drops out of the sky, and lowers a rope down</br>
 to the cash. A man in a business suit slides down the rope, commando style,</br>
 and captures the money in his mouth, gives a contemptuous snort, mumbling</br>
 something like "sucker" under his breath. And then the helicopter is gone,</br>
 vanishing somewhere behind the radio towers spiking the top of Queen Anne</br>
 Hill.  Everything is quiet again.</br>
</br>
 I didn't just turn that TV off. I unplugged the motherfucker.</br>
