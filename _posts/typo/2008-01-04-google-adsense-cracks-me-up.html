title: 'Google AdSense cracks me up.'

I'm sure they have some supersmart algorithm for choosing ads based&nbsp; on page content, but it just seems to me that they pick one post that I make, and base all of their ads on that.&nbsp; Right now, all of my&nbsp; ads are centered around <a href="http://blog.folkwolf.net/articles/2007/12/17/adventures-in-closed-source-programming-part-1">Mac OS, and Sync</a> <br /><br />Next time I check, they'll probably be referencing SEO and AdSense.<br />
