title: 'Cleaning up fucking comment spam.'
---
I think I have finally washed my blog clean of all comment spam, and managed to figure out a way of making the spammers go away.  I couldn't figure out the MTCloseComments plugin, so I just figured out my own way of closing off comments after one week.  Email me if you want to know what I did, also, I went through the db, and cleaned out all the old spam that I missed the first time.</br>

The one downside of this is:  Now, no-one can comment on a post after one week.  If you find yourself trying to comment on closed posts a lot, email me and I can tweak the settings.
