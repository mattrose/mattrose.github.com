We hate Linux, and you should too.</br>
</br>
It's not often I advertise that I found a [new blog](http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/), but [this post](http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/2008/06/evolution-of-ubuntu-user.html) convinced me that this blog was something special.  I think it's actually a sign of the maturity of the Linux Community.  Though [some people](http://tuxtraining.com/2008/06/11/get-the-facts-straight/) don't have a sense of humour about it, and write pages-long screeds in response, the general response of the community is positive.  It's funny, and it's true.</br>
</br>
Here's a snippet that is *remarkably* true.</br>
</br>
<blockquote></br>
Here's the difference: Take a software product from some commercial company. If you ever get a chance to get through the marketing folks and talk to their devs, chances are that they know exactly all the ways concerning how their products suck. They'll have a huge list of reasons of why they can't implement some feature that you, non-paying, ass-hat, non-customer, wants. And then they'll tell you what they should, "Show me the money, or bugger off. We're working here." And then they'll talk shit behind your back about how you have no idea what it takes to ship reliable working complex software.</br>
</br>
What do you get in the Linux world? Actually, most of the devs are the same. They wrote the code. They know how it sucks. They wrote it for fun, and they don't give a fuck. But some fucktard user who thinks his limp dick is great software comes along and starts talking like it is the shit. And he has to tell everyone else. And if you don't agree? fuck, you must be in that other camp.</br>
</br>
But really, thanks for that comment. Sometimes it does take someone to shit on my front porch before I can really describe the stench to you.</br>

<b>UPDATE:</b></br>
</br>
I've been working on a Mac port of [Terminator](https://launchpad.net/terminator) recently, It's written in Python, so it would be easy you would think.  Except I haven't gotten past the font-rendering conundrum.   The [Linux Hater](http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/) feels my pain.  I'm going to have to figure out how to hook vte into the mac font renderer.</br>
