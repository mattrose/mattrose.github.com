title: 'That does it,  Im definitely a dog person.'

Found this in my travels.<br /><br />&nbsp;In 1870, nine years before he became a U.S. Senator, attorney George<br />&nbsp;Vest (D-MO) defended a farmer whose hunting dog, "Old Drum," had<br />&nbsp;allegedly been killed by a neighbor.&nbsp; Vest didnï¿½t call anyone to the<br />&nbsp;witness chair or trot out exhibit A, B, C or D.&nbsp; Instead, he simply<br />&nbsp;said this...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gentlemen of the jury:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best friend a man has in this world may turn against him and<br />&nbsp;become his enemy.&nbsp; His son or daughter that he has reared with loving<br />&nbsp;care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us,<br />&nbsp;those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name, may become<br />&nbsp;traitors to their faith. The money that a man has, he may lose. It<br />&nbsp;flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it most.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered<br />&nbsp;action. The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor<br />&nbsp;when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice<br />&nbsp;when failure settles its clouds upon our heads. The one absolutely<br />&nbsp;unselfish friend that a man can have in this selfish world, the one<br />&nbsp;that never deserts him and the one that never proves ungrateful or<br />&nbsp;treacherous is his dog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gentlemen of the jury, a man's dog stands by him in prosperity and<br />&nbsp;in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold<br />&nbsp;ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if<br />&nbsp;only he may be near his master's side.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer. He will lick the<br />&nbsp;wounds and sores that come in encounters with the roughness of the<br />&nbsp;world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince.<br />&nbsp;When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings and<br />&nbsp;reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in<br />&nbsp;its journey through the heavens.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If fortune drives the master forth an outcast in the world,<br />&nbsp;friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than<br />&nbsp;that of accompanying him to guard against danger, to fight against his<br />&nbsp;enemies, and when the last scene of all comes and death takes the<br />&nbsp;master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no<br />&nbsp;matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by his graveside<br />&nbsp;will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad<br />&nbsp;but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even to death."<br /><br /><br />
