title: 'Folkwolf Network Upgraded'
---
While I was visiting family in Toronto, I took the opportunity to visit the Apple Store.&nbsp; I needed a new battery for my laptop, it had dis-appeared when I came back from Burning Man.&nbsp; For some reason, even though the batter was installed, it wouldn't charge, and it wouldn't show up in the battery monitor.&nbsp; The Apple Store was nice enough to replace it free of charge, and they even cleaned up my grotty keyboard.&nbsp; So I bought an Apple Airport Extreme, and plugged it in to the network, so hopefully, the periodic outages will now go away.&nbsp; Also, the whole wireless network is up to 802.11n now, so it's a lot faster<br />
