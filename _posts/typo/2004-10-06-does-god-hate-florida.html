title: 'Does God Hate Florida?'
---
This is a wicked <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2004/10/01/notes100104.DTL&nl=fix"> </br>
column</a> from the SF Chron</br>
</br>
So then, the vicious hurricanes can't possibly be God's wrath, because Florida is Jeb Bush Country and everyone knows all Bushes are blessed WASP Mafioso with first-class seats on the glory train to salvation, and therefore the storms can only be explained by that other barely tolerable thing the Bible set really hates trying to comprehend: science.</br>
[...]</br>
But wait. That can't be right. It can't be science because the storms can't be in any way related to climate change or global warming, because as Bush policy has shown, nature is a merely a huge, exploitable sandbox for the rich and global warming is a big fat liberal myth and the Kyoto Treaty is a pathetic joke despite all those reams of international, world-class scientific evidence to the contrary. So, you know, screw science.
