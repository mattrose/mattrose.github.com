title: 'Best. Rider. Ever.'
---
And I mean that in both senses.&nbsp; </br>
</br>
I've been in a band (never one that could get away with a rider), and I've done sound crew and stage crew stuff since I was a teenager.&nbsp; In that capacity, I saw a lot of riders.&nbsp; None were as funny or as informative as <a href="http://http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/1004061iggypop1.html">this one</a>.&nbsp; </br>
</br>
I've always felt Road Managers lived between a rock and a hard place.&nbsp; Their entire livelihood depends on how someone else "feels" on a particular day.&nbsp; All they can do is have everything set up so that the performer has the best environment possible.&nbsp; Which means they have to be the most demanding motherfuckers.&nbsp; This manager obviously is comfortable with the fact, and has fun with it.</br>

Favourite quotes:</br>
</br>
<blockquote>1 X KORG 2000 DIGITAL RACK TUNER.&nbsp; Digital in the sense that it works via an electronically generated number system, not digital because it only works if someone holds it together with their fingers.</br>
</blockquote></br>
<blockquote>For the sidefills, can we have two great big enormous things please, of a type that might be venerated as gods by the inhabitants of Easter Island, capable of reaching volumes that could provide the power for a Monster Truck Rally.</br>
</blockquote></br>
<blockquote>Can I just sat that we like to keep it as clear as possible, especially at the front?&nbsp; My insurance doesn't cover me for allowing Rockstarts to fall off the front of the stage. [ ... ]&nbsp; This way, Iggy can run around in his customary manner, like a crazed running-around-type-thing, and we can all relax in a haze of self-satisfied panic.</br>

<blockquote>NO YAMAHAS and NO BLEEDING DIGITAL or I will chop it into a hundred pieces, and each of those pieces I will chop into a hundred pieces ... so that's like, er ... tenty hundred?&nbsp; Anyway, then I will douse them in petrol and burn them.&nbsp; In accordance wuth local and national guidelines on the burning of bits of shit mixer, of course.</br>
