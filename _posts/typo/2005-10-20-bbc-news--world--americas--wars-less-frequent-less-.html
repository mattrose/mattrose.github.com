title: 'BBC NEWS | World | Americas | Wars less frequent, less deadly'
---
I get an RSS feed from the BBC and this showed up, the day after I went to see Romeo D'allaire.  It was, terrible timing, to say the least.</br>
</br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4350860.stm">BBC NEWS Wars 'less frequent, less deadly'</a></br>
</br>
</br>
 That's a really rose-colored report.  When you think of all the genocides</br>
 and ethnic cleansings and child armies that have exploded since the end of</br>
 the Cold War, war may have gotten slightly less deadly, but a whole lot</br>
 dirtier.  I was at a lecture by Romeo D'Allaire, the commander of the UN</br>
 forces during the failed Rwanda mission on Tuesday, and he asked a</br>
 question which illustrates war in these times, I'll have to paraphrase it,</br>
 because I didn't take notes, but the question goes something like this.</br>
</br>
 "We came upon a small village in Rwanda, and we were looking for</br>
 survivors, and once we came upon the church, villagers started streaming</br>
 out of it, which was unusual, because the normal way of doing things was</br>
 to round up the entire village, lock all of the villagers in the church,</br>
 and burn it down.  In this case, we thought we were lucky, because the</br>
 villagers came streaming out of the church when we came into view.</br>
 Suddenly a bunch of young boys between the ages of 9 and 14 came out of</br>
 the jungle on our right, and started firing at us with AK-47s.  Then a</br>
 bunch of young girls about the same ages, some of whom were pregnant,</br>
 appeared out of the jungle on our left, they were being used as human</br>
 shields by yet more young boys with AK-47s firing at us, and the villagers</br>
 coming out of the Church.  Now, knowing that most of these children were</br>
 forced into camps, brainwashed, and pressed into service under penalty of</br>
 death, knowing that these children had a "Buddy system" where if your</br>
 buddy ran away, you were shot, knowing that these children where only</br>
 unknowing automatons, probably given drugs to commit this act, what do you</br>
 do?  You have nanoseconds to make a decision, and bullets are killing</br>
 both your soldiers, as well as the villagers all around you."</br>
</br>
</br>
 What do you do, indeed.  It's a heartbreaking question.  Luckily, he</br>
 didn't ask us the answer to the question, and I think the answer he came</br>
 up with on that spot has haunted his dreams for more than 10 years now.</br>
