title: 'This is how to run a good support department'
---
<br />A few years back I got burnt out on doing Systems Admin work, and went to doing Technical Support.&nbsp; I've worked for a number of companies in their support departments.&nbsp; I've been lucky enough to work for companies and managers I've worked for have espoused a number of these principles.&nbsp; Never all of them, but some of them.<br /><br />When I worked at Mitel, I was talking to one of the other support guys, I'm pretty sure it was Richard Turner, and he was telling me a story about a really thorny problem he was trying to troubleshoot.&nbsp; The product line support manager walked in, said "How are things going?"&nbsp; "No good" says Richard, " I still don't know what's going on".<br /><br />Half an hour later, the Support Manager walks in "How are things going?"&nbsp; Same answer.&nbsp; Half an hour after that, the Director walks in, and has the same conversation.&nbsp; A little while later, the VP walks in, and has the same conversation.&nbsp; At this point Richared is like "Why won't the bigwigs just leave me alone to work this?"&nbsp; Anyone who's ever worked in support has thought this on numerous occasions.&nbsp; A little while later, the CTO walks in, and has the same conversation.<br /><br />About three hours into troubleshooting, Terry Matthews walks in and asks the tech how things are going, and gets the same answer.&nbsp; He then asks "Would it help if you were on site?".&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard&nbsp; says "yes", then Terry says, "All right, be at the airport at 2:00"&nbsp;&nbsp; Terry and Richard fly down to St. Louis on Terry's private jet, arrive in St. Louis and have the problem solved by 4pm, St. Louis time.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html">Seven steps to remarkable customer service - Joel on Software</a> <br /><br />Update:&nbsp; Seth Godin has his own ideas here<br /><br /><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/02/starting_over_w.html">Seth's Blog: Starting over with customer service</a>
