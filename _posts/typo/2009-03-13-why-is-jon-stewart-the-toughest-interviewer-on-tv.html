title: 'Why is Jon Stewart the toughest interviewer on TV?'
---
This is for all the Canuck viewers out there, but this <a href="http://watch.thecomedynetwork.ca/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart/full-episodes/march-12-2009/#clip147737">interview with Jim Cramer</a> is actually uncomfortable, it's pressing, it's everything a good interview should be.  It's not very funny, for that see <a href="http://watch.thecomedynetwork.ca/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart/full-episodes/march-12-2009/#clip147736">part 1</a>, but man is it good.</br>
</br>
At the end of the show, Jon Stewart says "I hope that was as uncomfortable to watch as it was to do".  Yep.
