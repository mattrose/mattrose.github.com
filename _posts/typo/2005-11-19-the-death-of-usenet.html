Jack kapica from the Globe and Mail writes about <a href="http://www.globetechnology.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20051117.gtjkcolumnnov17/BNStory/Technology/">The death of Usenet</a>.

I even found my <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.my.head.hurts/browse_thread/thread/8e0d5011aa90623b/c278823853d69bae?lnk=st&q=mattrose%40achilles.net&rnum=112#c278823853d69bae">My first post</a>.  Dorky, huh?  Remember kids, whatever you write online is archived somewhere, forever.
