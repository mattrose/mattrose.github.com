title: 'Have we progressed?'
---
I don't often quote poetry, but this seems apropos.<br /><br />&nbsp;Turning and turning in the widening gyre<br />&nbsp;The falcon cannot hear the falconer;<br />&nbsp;Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br />&nbsp;Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br />&nbsp;The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere<br />&nbsp;The ceremony of innocence is drowned;<br />&nbsp;The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br />&nbsp;Are full of passionate intensity.<br />&nbsp;Surely some revelation is at hand;<br />&nbsp;Surely the Second Coming is at hand.<br />&nbsp;The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out<br />&nbsp;When a vast image out of "Spiritus Mundi"<br />&nbsp;Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert<br />&nbsp;A shape with lion body and the head of a man,<br />&nbsp;A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,<br />&nbsp;Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it<br />&nbsp;Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.<br />&nbsp;The darkness drops again; but now I know<br />&nbsp;That twenty centuries of stony sleep<br />&nbsp;Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,<br />&nbsp;And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br />&nbsp;Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;-- William Butler Yeats, "The Second Coming"<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/37319">Get Smooved | The Onion - America's Finest News Source</a> <br /> <blockquote>Then, when we have each finished eating our meals, I will lay your body down on a bedsheet comprised of 100 percent silk, which I will purchase in advance from the finest store in this city. Then, just before we freak, I will inquire as to how you like the feel of the sheets. If you inform me that you do not like it, I will travel to other cities around the world until I locate a store that sells sheets that are more to your satisfaction. Then, I will purchase those sheets and return home to put them on the bed for you.

It is then that I will hit you doggy-style.
