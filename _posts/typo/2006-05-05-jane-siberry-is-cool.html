<a href="http://www.smoe.org/nbh">Jane Sibbery</a> is one of the nicest musicians I've ever had the privilege to meet.  She asked me to be her roadie at one point.  In 1996, she'd decided to get the rights back to all the songs that she could, and release them on <a href="http://www.sheeba.ca/">her own record label</a>.  Just recently, she decided to change her pricing policy on her online record store.  She calls it "self-determined pricing"</br>
