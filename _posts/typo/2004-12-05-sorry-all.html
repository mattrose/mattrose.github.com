title: 'Sorry All'
---
Sorry to everyone affected by the Outage from Thursday at approximately 11am to friday at approximately 3pm.  A total of 28 hours.  Unfortunately, I trusted my internet provider to do a lot of the things that ISPs are supposed to do.  Needless to say, Chris and I are working on a plan to alleviate such failures in the future.  Sorry all.  I was just as pissed of as I'm sure some of you were.
