title: 'metallic, with a hint of fruit'

<a href="http://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2009/01/innovation-or-catastrophe-scratching.html">Bike Snob</a> makes me look positively sociable:

<blockquote>The world, as we all know, is filled with idiots. This is particularly apparent if you travel by bicycle. The bicycle allows you to cover great distances, thus exposing you to a wide cross-section of idiocy. Also, because you are exposed and at street level, there is no barrier protecting you from that idiocy. While you can see idiocy from the window of a car, bus, or train, you don't also get to feel, touch, taste and smell idiocy like you can while on a bicycle. (If you're wondering, idiocy tastes metallic, with a hint of fruit.)
