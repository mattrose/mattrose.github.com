I finally have a job.  It's at <a href="http://www.mkcnetworks.com">MKC Networks</a>, doing product support for their tres cool SIP PBX (basically a VoIP office phone switch)  It's actually the same one I worked on at <a href="http://www.mitel.com">Mitel Networks</a> (Mitel Networks was contracted to do the initial support and release, IIRC) so I know the product.

I'm tres happy, and I'm going out to see <a href="http://www.kelprecords.com/bands/1978/index.html">South of 78</a>, and <a href="http://www.tunevault.com/artist/show.asp?ID=256">the Fiftymen </a>tonight at Irene's so if anyone wants to come out and celebrate with me, as well as listen to some kick-ass alt-country, the more the merrier.
