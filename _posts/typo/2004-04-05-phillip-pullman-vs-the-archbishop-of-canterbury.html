title: 'Phillip Pullman vs. The Archbishop of Canterbury.'
---
Someone on the WeLL pointed this page from the Daily Telegraph which is an interesting discussion between Phillip Pullman, the author of the "His Dark Materials" trilogy, which has been criticized as being anti-catholic, and anti-organized religion in general.  It's a series of fantasy books that's extremely well-written, but not one of those earth-shattering books, especially if you're an atheist or agnostic already.  I took it as fairly light reading.  However, there did seem to be a sense of something more, something that the author was saying, but that was a little beyond thought, or comprehension.  This discussion is what all debate should be like.  Intelligent, thoughtful discourse on a subject that both participants have extensive and intimate knowledge of.  (I realize that sentence ends with a preposition, it just makes more sense that way)

Update.  Ugly prose back there.  Will fix it up if I get the chance.
