I can't tell you how good this is.<br /><br /><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/corporate-solar-is-coming.html">Official Google Blog: Corporate solar is coming</a> <br /> <blockquote>Soon we plan to begin installation of 1.6 megawatts of solar photovoltaic panels at our Mountain View campus. This project will be the largest solar installation on any corporate campus in the U.S., and we think it's one of the largest on any corporate site in the world. The panels will cover the roofs of the four main buildings of the Googleplex, and also those of two additional buildings across the street. There will also be a portion of this installation on new solar panel support structures in a few parking lots. The amount of electricity that will be generated is equivalent to powering about 1,000 average California homes. Weâ€™ll use that electricity to power several of our Mountain View office facilities, offsetting approximately 30% of our peak electricity consumption at those buildings. <br /></blockquote>
