</br>
Hostel Location:  Is the location of the Hostel we stayedat, and had breakfast every day, and Dinner tuesday and thursday, IIRC.</br>
</br>
Carpark:  Is where we had stashed the car for most of the time we were in SF.</br>
</br>
Room:  Is the room where we stayed at.  It belonged to the hostel, but, as you can see, it was about a block and a half away.</br>
</br>
As you can tell, we walked right past the location of the landslide several times a day.
