<br />Jim Buckmaster, the CEO of <a href="http://www.craigslist.com">Craigslist</a> meeting Wall street bankers.<br /><br /><a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/12/08/craigslist-meets-the-capitalists/?8dpc">Craigslist Meets the Capitalists - Mergers, Acquisitions, Venture Capital, Hedge Funds -- DealBook - New York Times</a><br /><br /><blockquote><strong>UBS</strong> analyst Ben Schachter wanted to know how
Craigslist plans to maximize revenue. It doesn’t, Mr. Buckmaster
replied (perhaps wondering how Mr. Schachter could possibly not already
know this). “That definitely is not part of the equation,” he said,
according to MediaPost. “It’s not part of the goal.”<br /></blockquote>
