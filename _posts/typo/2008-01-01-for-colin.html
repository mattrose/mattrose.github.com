<blockquote>That's what some dude says here to explain why Gates always gives the big keynote address at the CES show. Money quote: "He's kind of like the pope of our industry. And as the pope, he always draws a crowd and people follow every word he says. You either go to heaven or you don't, if you have the Microsoft blessing." Holy crap. I just threw up in my mouth. FWIW, this year's CES show begins Sunday, if you care. I know I don't.</br>

DISCLAIMER: Bill Gates is not actually the spiritual leader of the Roman Catholic church.</blockquote>
