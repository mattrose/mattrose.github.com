Wikipedia surfing brought this to my attention.  It's a diary entry from a party that crossed the Great Salt Desert in 1850.</br>
</br>
<blockquote>Finally Allen and one of the other men dropped to the ground exhausted, when, to the amusement of the others, Allen began to pray.</br>
</br>
"O Lord Almighty, send us just one drop of rain!" Immediately from a few fleecy clouds scattering rain drops began to fall, and as Allen and his companions had a rubber blanket, they quickly spread it out. But not a sufficient quantity of water fell to admit of its running together</blockquote></br>
