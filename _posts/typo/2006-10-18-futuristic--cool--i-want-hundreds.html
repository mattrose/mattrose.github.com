<a href="http://www.sun.com/emrkt/blackbox/story.jsp">Project Blackbox</a> is the newest product from SUN Microsystems.&nbsp; It's a Datacenter in a shipping container. <br /><br />Plug in a network connection, and power, and you've got up to 2000 CPUs, 1.5 petabytes of Disk Storage, and 7 TB of memory.<br /><br />It's portable, in a weird sense of the word.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is one thing that this project doesn't have, that it needs to succeed, IMO.<br />a BIG HONKING UPS.&nbsp; If you put one of those in there, you could place it anywhere, cover it in solar panels, and you'd be off to the races.<br />
