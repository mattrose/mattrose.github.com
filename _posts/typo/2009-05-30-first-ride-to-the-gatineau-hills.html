title: 'First Ride to the Gatineau Hills'
---
I did my first ride up to the Gatineau Hills today.  It was as hard as I expected, but it was still a lot nicer than I remember it.  I only made it to the bottom of the Pink Lake Hill because I want to go on another bike ride tomorrow, so I didn't feel like pushing it.</br>

Also, there's a whitewater kayak course right near my house in behind the new condo building accross from the War Museum</br>
