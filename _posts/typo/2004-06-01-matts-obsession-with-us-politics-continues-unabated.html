title: 'Matts obsession with US Politics continues unabated'

I always enjoy a good speech.  To me, it seems like the idea of a good speech is one that is more highly prized in Canada than most places.  I could go on and on about what constitutes a good intelligent speech, but <a href="http://www.moveonpac.org/goreremarks052604.html">This speech</a> by Al Gore fits all the criteria.  Even if you don't agree with the content, he makes a good case for it.
