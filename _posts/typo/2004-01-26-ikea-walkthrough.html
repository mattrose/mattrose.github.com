title: 'IKEA Walkthrough'

Walkthroughs are a form of cheating for video games.  It's basically a description of the game, the missions, some easy ways of doing the missions,  and locations for various items that might come in handy.  This is the best and funniest walkthrough I've ever seen.
The <a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/how_to/the_nonexpert_ikea.php">link is here</a>, and I found it on <a href="http://boingboing.net">boingboing</a>

I took away the text of it below.  The Morning News guys told me it was copyrighted and I'd have to talk to them about reproducing it.  I think that's entirely fair, and I encourage everyone to go to their site to see it.
