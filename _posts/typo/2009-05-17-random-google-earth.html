<a href="http://www.panoramio.com//photo/2252423">This</a> is where we camped after our first year going to BM.  It's only about a 6 hour drive from Burning Man to the Northern California coast, but you might as well be on a different planet.  After being in the desert, the cold damp was a huge shock.  We ended up wearing all of our winter gear all the time, usually good to about -25C
