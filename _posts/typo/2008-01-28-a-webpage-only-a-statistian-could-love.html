They used a simplified model of the game without considering the effects of the Chance and Community Chest cards or of the various ways of being sent to jail.

I was intrigued enough with this problem that I started working on trying to find the probabilities for landing on the different squares with all of the rules taken into account. I ran into some interesting problems but finally came up with the right answers, which you will find here along with some other useful derived data. Incidentally, I'm not much of a Monopoly® player myself, but I've always enjoyed interesting problems involving probability and statistics, of which this was one.</blockquote>
