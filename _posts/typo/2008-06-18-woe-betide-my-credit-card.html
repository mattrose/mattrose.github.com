title: 'Woe betide my Credit Card'
---


I've finally done it.  I've finally drunk the iTMS kool-aid.  

Back when I used to work in the Glebe, I would visit Compact Music at least twice a week.   I would usually buy at least one or two items at least once a week.  I listen to music constantly, at work, or at home when I'm sitting by myself.


Somebody gave me a $20 itunes card for Christmas, which I found not that long ago.  I used it to buy a couple of CDs.  Then, a week or so later, I heard something on the radio, and bought that CD, then, "Old Man Luedecke" popped into my head, so I had to get his entire collection.  Then somebody mentioned that they really liked the new Constantines CD, so I bought that.
