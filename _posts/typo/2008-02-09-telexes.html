title: 'Telexes'
---
When I was growing up in Somalia, <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10609367" title="Telex | A faint ping  | Economist.com">telexes</a> were the main means of communication for the UNDP.  My Dad would come home from work occasionally and tell us about sending an "angry telex" when things were going wrong.  I'm amazed and somewhat delighted that they still exist.
