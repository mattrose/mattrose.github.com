title: 'The End'
---
I've caught bits of the [cbc](http://www.cbc.ca) newsworld series ["The End"](http://www.cbc.ca/theend)  with [Jian Ghomeshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jian_Ghomeshi).  It's a cbc documentary on the old-news "Old Media vs. New Media" debate.  The series itself is somewhat tiresome, but I've noticed that on both the episodes I've seen, I've seen someone I've known while I was living in San Francisco.  I'm not sure what that means, or even if it's important to anyone else, I just thought it was weird.
