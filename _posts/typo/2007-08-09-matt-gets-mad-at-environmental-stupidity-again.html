<br />In the second installment in what seems like it could be <a href="http://http://blog.folkwolf.net/articles/2007/07/11/snowbird-this">an ongoing series</a>, I found this.<br /><br />WTF?&nbsp; A bylaw against <u><b>not</b></u> watering your lawn?&nbsp; Fucking Utah.<br /><br />Actually, I kinda like Utah.&nbsp; Half the state super-mountainy, half the state super-flat.&nbsp; It's got it all, scenery wise.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ksl.com/?sid=1444771&amp;nid=148">ksl.com - Woman Arrested for Not Watering Lawn</a> <br /> <blockquote>A widow and grandma spent the morning in jail, arrested for refusing to give a policeman her name when he tried writing her a ticket for failing to water her yard. The woman hasn't watered her lawn in more than a year, and the condition of her yard violates an Orem zoning ordinance.</blockquote>
