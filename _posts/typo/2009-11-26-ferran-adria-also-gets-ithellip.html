title: 'Ferran Adria also gets it&hellip;'

<p>From a <a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6105.html">case study</a> of a high end restaurant.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The case also highlights the distinction between understanding and listening to customers. &quot;Adri√†'s idea is that if you listen to customers, what they tell you they want will be based on something they already know,&quot; Norton observes. &quot;If I like a good steak, you can serve that to me, and I'll enjoy it. But it will never be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. To create those experiences, you almost can't listen to the customer.&quot;</p></blockquote>
