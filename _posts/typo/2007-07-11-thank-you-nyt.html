title: 'Thank you NYT.'

<br />This Editorial in the NYT plainly puts the case for getting the fuck out of Iraq now.&nbsp; It manages to be both succinct, very convincing, and bring up argument after argument hammering the point home that the Bush Administration has fucked.&nbsp; up. big, and fixing it is going to be even harder than the original invasion.<br /><br />It's probably going to go behind a pay wall at some point, so I'll put the most interesting excerpts here.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/opinion/08sun1.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin">The Road Home - New York Times</a> <br /> <blockquote>It is time for the United States to leave Iraq, without any more delay than the Pentagon needs to organize an orderly exit.<br /></blockquote><blockquote>Like many Americans, we have put off that conclusion, waiting for a<br />sign that President Bush was seriously trying to dig the United States<br />out of the disaster he created by invading Iraq without sufficient<br />cause, in the face of global opposition, and without a plan to<br />stabilize the country afterward.<br /><br /><p>At first, we believed that after destroying Iraq’s government, army,<br />police and economic structures, the United States was obliged to try to<br />accomplish some of the goals Mr. Bush claimed to be pursuing, chiefly<br />building a stable, unified Iraq. When it became clear that the<br />president had neither the vision nor the means to do that, we argued<br />against setting a withdrawal date while there was still some chance to<br />mitigate the chaos that would most likely follow.</p><p>While Mr. Bush<br />scorns deadlines, he kept promising breakthroughs — after elections,<br />after a constitution, after sending in thousands more troops. But those<br />milestones came and went without any progress toward a stable,<br />democratic Iraq or a path for withdrawal. It is frighteningly clear<br />that Mr. Bush’s plan is to stay the course as long as he is president<br />and dump the mess on his successor. Whatever his cause was, it is lost.<br /></p><p>Continuing to sacrifice the lives and limbs of American soldiers is<br />wrong. The war is sapping the strength of the nation’s alliances and<br />its military forces. It is a dangerous diversion from the<br />life-and-death struggle against terrorists. It is an increasing burden<br />on American taxpayers, and it is a betrayal of a world that needs the<br />wise application of American power and principles.</p><br /><p>That conversation must be candid and focused. Americans must be<br />clear that Iraq, and the region around it, could be even bloodier and<br />more chaotic after Americans leave. There could be reprisals against<br />those who worked with American forces, further ethnic cleansing, even<br />genocide. Potentially destabilizing refugee flows could hit Jordan and<br />Syria. Iran and Turkey could be tempted to make power grabs. Perhaps<br />most important, the invasion has created a new stronghold from which<br />terrorist activity could proliferate.</p><p>The administration, the<br />Democratic-controlled Congress, the United Nations and America’s allies<br />must try to mitigate those outcomes — and they may fail. But Americans<br />must be equally honest about the fact that keeping troops in Iraq will<br />only make things worse. The nation needs a serious discussion, now,<br />about how to accomplish a withdrawal and meet some of the big<br />challenges that will arise.</p></blockquote><blockquote>Despite President Bush’s repeated claims, Al Qaeda had no significant<br />foothold in Iraq before the invasion, which gave it new base camps, new<br />recruits and new prestige.&nbsp; <br /><p>This war diverted Pentagon resources from Afghanistan, where the<br />military had a real chance to hunt down Al Qaeda’s leaders. It<br />alienated essential allies in the war against terrorism. It drained the<br />strength and readiness of American troops. </p>    <p>And it created a new front where the United States will have to continue to battle terrorist forces<br /></p><p>One of Mr. Bush’s arguments against withdrawal is that it would lead to<br />civil war. That war is raging, right now, and it may take years to burn<br />out. Iraq may fragment into separate Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite<br />republics, and American troops are not going to stop that from<br />happening.<br /></p><p>The United States military cannot solve the problem. Congress and<br />the White House must lead an international attempt at a negotiated<br />outcome. To start, Washington must turn to the United Nations, which<br />Mr. Bush spurned and ridiculed as a preface to war.<br /></p><p>Washington also has to mend fences with allies. There are new<br />governments in Britain, France and Germany that did not participate in<br />the fight over starting this war and are eager to get beyond it. But<br />that will still require a measure of humility and a commitment to<br />multilateral action that this administration has never shown.<br /></p><p>President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have used demagoguery<br />and fear to quell Americans’ demands for an end to this war. They say<br />withdrawing will create bloodshed and chaos and encourage terrorists.<br />Actually, all of that has already happened — the result of this<br />unnecessary invasion and the incompetent management of this war.</p><p>This<br />country faces a choice. We can go on allowing Mr. Bush to drag out this<br />war without end or purpose. Or we can insist that American troops are<br />withdrawn as quickly and safely as we can manage — with as much effort<br />as possible to stop the chaos from spreading. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><span class="bold"><br /></span></p><br /><br /></blockquote>
