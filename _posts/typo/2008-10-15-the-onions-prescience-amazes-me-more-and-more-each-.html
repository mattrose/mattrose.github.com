title: 'The Onions prescience amazes me more and more each day'
---
After <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/33930">Fuck Everything, We're Doing Five Blades</a>, I realized that The Onion was some kind of hilarious Oracle.  <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784">Bush: 'Our Long National Nightmare Of Peace And Prosperity Is Finally Over'</a> has once again proved my faith.

The following was written <strong>Eight Years Ago</strong>

<blockquote>During the 40-minute speech, Bush also promised to bring an end to the severe war drought that plagued the nation under Clinton, assuring citizens that the U.S. will engage in at least one Gulf War-level armed conflict in the next four years.

"You better believe we're going to mix it up with somebody at some point during my administration," said Bush, who plans a 250 percent boost in military spending. "Unlike my predecessor, I am fully committed to putting soldiers in battle situations. Otherwise, what is the point of even having a military?" 

On the economic side, Bush vowed to bring back economic stagnation by implementing substantial tax cuts, which would lead to a recession, which would necessitate a tax hike, which would lead to a drop in consumer spending, which would lead to layoffs, which would deepen the recession even further. </blockquote>
