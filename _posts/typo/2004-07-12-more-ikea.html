title: 'More Ikea'
---
I'm thinking of renaming this the IKEA-blog, and have it be entirely links to IKEA, the sociology and psychology of IKEA-Lovers and IKEA-haters.  I think it would be fascinating, but ah, why bother, I <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64088,00.html">have a life.</a>  Instead I give you this <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,1240462,00.html">nice Guardian article</a> instead, from which I also give you a quote.</br>
</br>
Flatpack meant making things so cheap, in fact, that furniture, instead of accumulating emotional weight as it was passed down the generations, would come to seem transient and disposable - and that one recent soggy Saturday, in a seethingly crowded branch of Ikea at Brent Park, north London, a young couple would gaze at a Lack sidetable, and then, with fond exasperation, at each other, and have the following conversation:</br>
</br>
"But it's only £8."</br>
</br>
"But we don't need it."</br>
</br>
"But it's only £8!"</br>
</br>
"But we don't ... OK. Whatever. Whatever."
