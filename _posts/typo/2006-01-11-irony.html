<strong style="font-size: 14px">TOKYO, Japan (Reuters) -- Firemen in a small Japanese town were left red-faced after a party to mark the end of a fire awareness promotional event ended in a blaze that badly damaged their station.</strong></br>
</br>
The two-story wooden fire station in Shimohetsugi, southern Japan, was extensively damaged by the Sunday blaze, a spokesman for the Oita prefectural fire department said.</br>
</br>
No one was injured in the fire, which is thought to have been started either by a gas canister used for the firemen's barbecue or by a kerosene heater.</br>
</br>
"It's very embarrassing that this should happen to people whose job it is to go and put out fires," the spokesman said.
