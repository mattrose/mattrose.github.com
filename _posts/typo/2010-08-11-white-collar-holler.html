title: 'White Collar Holler'
---
This song was taught to me during an otherwise execrable time in my life, by a fantastic music teacher.  I was thrilled to meet him and yet again be in his choir as an adult, both at the Blue Skies Music Festival, and the Ottawa Folk Festival.</br>

Stan Rogers has been heralded as the voice of the ordinary Canadian, and while most of his songs are about Fishermen, or Farmers, this one proves that he could empathize with all walks of life.  It's become a kind of anthem of mine, as much as Jeannie C is an anthem of Nova Scotia Fishermen, or The Field Behind the Plow is an anthem of Canadian Prairie Farmers.</br>
</br>
I just think the concept of an old style Holler about working in a cube farm is hilarious and ingenious at the same time</br>
