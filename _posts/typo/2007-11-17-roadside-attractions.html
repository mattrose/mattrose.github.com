Most roadside attractions are tourist traps that do everything in their power to draw tourists into the town to stop at the local diner, or advertise a piece of local history.<br /><br />Every time we drive to Burning Man, after hours of driving through the Great Salt Desert in Utah, we come across this:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.folkwolf.net/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=3852&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" /><br /><br />There's no plaque, no radio station, It's illegal to even pull over and take a picture of the damn thing.&nbsp; And it's stuck out in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp; I always had a vague curiousity as to what it was.&nbsp; I was sure it was a piece of art, but why would someone build a huge tree in the middle of the desert.<br /><br />I used the internets to discover:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.utah.com/amusement/metaphor_tree.htm">Metaphor: Tree of Utah | Utah.com</a>
