title: 'Intelligence Failures?'

In this article: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/11/AR2005111101623.html">The Right Way in Iraq</a> John Edwards says</br>
<blockquote></br>
The argument for going to war with Iraq was based on intelligence that we now know was inaccurate. The information the American people were hearing from the president -- and that I was being given by our intelligence community -- wasn't the whole story. Had I known this at the time, I never would have voted for this war.</br>
</blockquote></br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
And in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/18/AR2005111802397.html">this article</a> Sen. Bob Graham tellingly states:</br>
<blockquote></br>
The American people needed to know these reservations, and I requested that an unclassified, public version of the NIE be prepared. On Oct. 4, Tenet presented a 25-page document titled "Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction Programs." It represented an unqualified case that Hussein possessed them, avoided a discussion of whether he had the will to use them and omitted the dissenting opinions contained in the classified version. Its conclusions, such as "If Baghdad acquired sufficient weapons-grade fissile material from abroad, it could make a nuclear weapon within a year," underscored the White House's claim that exactly such material was being provided from Africa to Iraq.</br>
</blockquote></br>
<blockquote></br>
From my advantaged position, I had earlier concluded that a war with Iraq would be a distraction from the successful and expeditious completion of our aims in Afghanistan. Now I had come to question whether the White House was telling the truth -- or even had an interest in knowing the truth.</br>
</blockquote></br>
</br>
</br>
<blockquote></br>
On Oct. 11, I voted no on the resolution to give the president authority to go to war against Iraq. I was able to apply caveat emptor. Most of my colleagues could not.</br>
</blockquote></br>
</br>
What happened wasn't an intelligence failure, it was a deliberate distortion of intelligence that Senators "fell for".  This has to come out at some point.</br>
