title: 'Why DRM doesnt work'
---
This seems to be my week for putting geeks up on pedestals.  My last entry was JWZ, this one talks about <a href="http://www.craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a></br>
</br>
Cory gives the most concise definition of why DRM doesn't work I've ever heard, and if you know anything about cryptography, you'll see why DRM falls down.</br>
</br>
But there's the rub. Alice wants Bob to buy Pirates of the</br>
Caribbean from her. Bob will only buy Pirates of the Caribbean if</br>
he can descramble the CSS-encrypted VOB -- video object -- on his</br>
DVD player. Otherwise, the disc is only useful to Bob as a</br>
drinks-coaster. So Alice has to provide Bob -- the attacker --</br>
with the key, the cipher and the ciphertext.</br>
</br>
There's  a lot of good stuff in there about why DRM doesn't work, as well as a lot of information about why DRM ultimately won't work.<a href="http://craphound.com/msftdrm.txt">Go read it</a>
