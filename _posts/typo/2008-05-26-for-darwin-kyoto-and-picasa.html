  </br>
 </br>
 TOKYO (AP) &#65533; When Yosuke the parrot flew out of his cage and got lost,</br>
 he did exactly what he had been taught &#65533; recite his name and address</br>
 to a stranger willing to help.</br>
 </br>
 Police rescued the African grey parrot two weeks ago from a neighbor's</br>
 roof in the city of Nagareyama, near Tokyo. After spending a night at</br>
 the station, he was transferred to a nearby veterinary hospital while</br>
 police searched for clues, local policeman Shinjiro Uemura said.</br>
 </br>
 He kept mum with the cops, but began chatting after a few days with</br>
 the vet.</br>
 </br>
 "I'm Mr. Yosuke Nakamura," the bird told the veterinarian, according</br>
 to Uemura. The parrot also provided his full home address, down to the</br>
 street number, and even entertained the hospital staff by singing</br>
 songs.</br>
