title: 'Swiffer != environmental disaster?'
---
I always thought of Swiffer mops as the ultimate in wasteful, environmentally harmful products.&nbsp; This interview witth the designer has me questioning some of my earlier assumptions.&nbsp; Water and detergents also have an environmental impact, too.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.inhabitat.com/2007/06/09/swiffer-sustainability-the-swiffer-designer-speaks-up">Inhabitat » SWIFFER SUSTAINABILITY: The swiffer designer speaks up</a> <br /> <blockquote>Gianfranco: The development of the Swiffer was the result of our analysis of what average American households actually do to clean their floors. We discovered—by doing a lot of research and observation in people’s homes—that, on the average, kitchen floors are washed once a week and that it requires a lot of hot water and detergent for washing and then more hot water for rinsing. We further realized—just by watching a lot of people mop their floors—that people spend more time cleaning the mop than cleaning the floor.</blockquote>
