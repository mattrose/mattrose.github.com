Two fascinating talks by people that you may not think are that fascinating.  Make sure you have about 35 minutes.  It'll fly by</br>

Mike Rowe is the narrator of "The deadliest catch", and the host of "Dirty Jobs".  In both shows he displays so much respect for the subjects of the shows.  This gives you an idea why.  Also, why "follow your passion" is the worst career and life advice </br>
