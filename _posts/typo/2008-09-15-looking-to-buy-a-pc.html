title: 'Looking to buy a PC'
---
I've decided to  re-join the dark side, and get another PC with (ewww) windows.  Problem is, the last PC I bought was probably about 8 years ago, and I have no idea what I'm looking for anymore.  Basically I want it to play games, but I'm not looking for a hardcore gaming machine.</br>

I'm asking the lazyweb where to buy a PC in Ottawa, I went to Best Buy, and they didn't have anything compelling there, and I went to Future Shop, but I couldn't get a sales-guys attention, even though I was standing around in the computer aisle playing halo for at least 10 minutes...</br>
