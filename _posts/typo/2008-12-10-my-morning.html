This post was originally a response to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/imckenna">@imckenna</a> when he sent me a facebook message responding to <a href="http://twitter.com/mattrose/status/1049142177">this tweet</a> but I ended up liking it enough to republish it here.</br>
</br>
I kinda included snow removal, but seeing as I don't have a driveway, that really shouldn't affect things.  Here's a more complete timeline.<br></br>
<ul></br>
<li>7:00 PM the night before.  Try desperately to get up to my usual parking spot on the street.  Can't make it.  Decide to park, w/o permission, in the parking lot across the street, mainly because it's had a plow run more recently and there's only 5-10 cm of snow in one part of the lot, whereas there's at least 25 on the street.</br>
<li>10pm Go to bed.</br>
<li>6:10  Get up, have a shower, make coffee, get dressed.</br>
<li>6:40  Glance out my front window, and notice the plow working on aforesaid parking lot, thinking to myself "I don't want him to call a tow-truck" I don my coat, and head out.   I start sweeping and scraping.</br>
<li>7:00 The plow nicely comes by and plows around the car, giving me the freedom to move around the parking lot a bit.  Also giving him the freedom to plow out my old spot.  I thank the plow driver and he proves himself a mensch by saying "Well, it was either that, or get out of the truck and help you push"  The plow and I dance around the parking lot for 15-20 minutes while he opens up more of the parking lot.  While there is a direct line to the street that is plowed, the street is covered with 35 cm of snow, and If I drive down the length of the street, there's a really good chance I'll get stuck.  If I wait until the plow clears the lot, I only drive down about 40 ft of the street, reducing my chances of getting stuck, so I dance around with the plow.</br>
<li>7:20.  Park the car in an already cleared area, and get out to say goodbye to liz</br>
<li>7:30 Help push a car out that got stuck on the street.</br>
<li>7:35 Get to the corner.</br>
<li>7:40  Finally rock the car off the snowbank that it got hung up on on the corner.</br>
</ul></br>

Update:  I got a parking pass from the lovely people at the Good Companions center, and I made a map:</br>
