I've loved <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/columnists/carroll/">Jon Carroll</a> ever since I joined the well, and I always considered his columns in the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/">Chron</a> the best editorials in the United States.  <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/04/08/DDG27BCFLG1.DTL">This</a> is why.  Apparently it has started a <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=unitarian+jihad&btnG=Search&meta=">cult</a>, including a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/whump/ujname.html">name generator</a>, which is where I got my new name.
