Not physically, but internetally.  After all the problems we had with <a href="http://www.istop.com/">istop</a> ,we decided to switch providers.  We're now connected through <a href="http://www.magma.ca">magma</a>, and hopefully much better and more reliable for it.  There was a lot of short-term pain involved, because I didn't really plan anything, but hopefully, things are back to normal now, and it'll work out to a lot of long term gain.
