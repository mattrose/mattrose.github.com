title: 'Virtualization for Mac.'

After seeing my post on <a href="http://blog.folkwolf.net/articles/2008/01/22/free-virtualization-for-mac">Free Virtualization for Mac</a>, Colin was kind enough to give me a copy of<a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/"> VMWare Fusion for Mac</a>.&nbsp; I have to say, it was a big improvement over the free VirtualBox.&nbsp; Not Free, but I had one mission for both:<br /><br />Get fullscreen working properly on my 1200X800 MacBook screen.<br /><br />With VirtualBox, I had to go in and edit the xorg.conf file directly to get my screen res working.&nbsp; With VMWARE, it was just a matter of picking the right screen res.<br /><br />Plus for VirtualBox, the VirtualBox tools install much easier on Ubuntu than the VMWare tools do<br />
