title: 'Yay, no more fucking BIOS.'
---
In this article:<a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060125-6045.html">Red Hat to make Linux run on Intel macs</a>, I read this quote:  </br>
<blockquote></br>
The current impediment is the Extensible Firmware Interface, a relatively new BIOS replacement designed by Intel that is not yet commonly used or widely supported.</br>
</blockquote></br>
</br>
All I could think of was Yay! Somebody finally realized that the PC BIOS, which has been around unchanged since the 80s, is fucking dumb.  Even dumber than OpenBoot, which has also been around since the 80s, but had the bonus of being written in Forth, IIRC
