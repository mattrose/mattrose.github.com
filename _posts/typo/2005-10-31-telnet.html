I shut off telnet a long time ago, mainly because it's not secure.  There is a program that replaces telnet for windows that is secure, and free.  You can <a href="http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe">get it here</a>.</br>
</br>
just download that and run it.  It's the same kind of thing as telnet, only encrypted.</br>
