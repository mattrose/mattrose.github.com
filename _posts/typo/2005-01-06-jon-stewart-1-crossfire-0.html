Mr. Klein is the president of CNN.</br>
</br>
<i>" Mr. Klein specifically cited the criticism that the comedian Jon Stewart</br>
 leveled at "Crossfire" when he was a guest on the program during the</br>
 presidential campaign. Mr. Stewart said that ranting partisan political</br>
 shows on cable were "hurting America."</br>
</br>
 Mr. Klein said last night, "I agree wholeheartedly with Jon Stewart's</br>
 overall premise." He said he believed that especially after the terror</br>
 attacks on 9/11, viewers are interested in information, not opinion."</br>
