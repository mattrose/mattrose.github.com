title: 'Switching folkwolf.net email over to Google apps for your domain.'

I was thinking of switching mail to google apps for your domain.<br /><br />Now that gmail is fully IMAP capable, and has a useful interface, and a whole bunch of other tie-ins <br /><br />Would folkwolf.net users be interested in this?<br />
