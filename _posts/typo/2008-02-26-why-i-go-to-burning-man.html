title: 'Why I go to Burning Man'
---
People ask me all the time, "Matt, why do you keep going back to Burning Man, year after year?"&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer is, a unique mix of geekery, insanity, and debauchery.&nbsp; Building intricate structures in an extremely harsh environment.&nbsp; Seeing the <a href="http://www.folkwolf.net/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=1113">Crazy</a> <a href="http://bigrigjig.com/wp-content/uploads/cache/lushioussmall_500x336.jpg">Shit</a> that <a href="http://www.folkwolf.net/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=1040">people</a> <a href="http://www.folkwolf.net/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=1206">build</a> there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting Drunk and going out and listening to music.<br /><br />A lot of the fun is the planning that goes into the entire deal.&nbsp; This is harder to explain, but when my longtime well-friend and former co-worker at SFInteractive posted <a href="http://www.matisse.net/bm/2008/">this</a> on the <a href="http://www.well.com">well</a>, I had to ask him if I could post it here.&nbsp; It illustrates so many things of what I like about Burning Man.&nbsp; Plus, if you're planning on attending, he's still looking for Range Safety Officers, so if you're planning on being at Burning Man, and have First Aid training, I highly suggest giving him a hand.<br />
