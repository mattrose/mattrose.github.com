I tweaked some sendmail settings that were introduced in the latest version, that should help combat spam, but could also cause some temporary delays of email.  If you have any mail that should have gone to you, but were bounced back, send me the bounce message, and we'll work it out.  More details on exactly what I did are below</br>
