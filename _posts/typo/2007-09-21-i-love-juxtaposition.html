title: 'I love juxtaposition'

<br />This is the best example of juxtaposition I've seen in a while<br /><br /><a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/37319">Get Smooved | The Onion - America's Finest News Source</a> <br /> <blockquote>Then, when we have each finished eating our meals, I will lay your body down on a bedsheet comprised of 100 percent silk, which I will purchase in advance from the finest store in this city. Then, just before we freak, I will inquire as to how you like the feel of the sheets. If you inform me that you do not like it, I will travel to other cities around the world until I locate a store that sells sheets that are more to your satisfaction. Then, I will purchase those sheets and return home to put them on the bed for you.

<br /><br />It is then that I will hit you doggy-style.
