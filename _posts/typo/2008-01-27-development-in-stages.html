I'm working on a blog engine.  I hope to have it eventually replace this blog, but I'm working on it in my spare time, so I leave it fallow for weeks at a time, and then pick it up and add a feature.  </br>
</br>
So I picked it up just now, saying to myself "I should implement comments", I fired up rails, and Lo, there was comments.  </br>
</br>
That's my work done for the day.</br>
</br>
Now I just have to figure out what to do next
