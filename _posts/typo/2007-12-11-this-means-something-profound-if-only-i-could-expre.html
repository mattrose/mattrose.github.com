"If you have two clocks ... you start asking, 'What time is it, really?'"<br /><p>
He wanted his children to see that relativity is proportional. So he
loaded the family's blue minivan with portable power supplies,
monitoring equipment, and three HP 5071 cesium clocks. Three, because
time is always marked relative to other clocks: More clocks mean more
accurate time. With his three kids and some camping gear in tow, he
drove the winding roads spiraling up Washington's Mt. Rainier and
checked the family into a lodge 5,319 feet above sea level.
</p><p>They hiked the trails, and the kids relaxed with board games
and books, while in the imperceptibly lessened gravity, time moved a
little bit faster than at home. Van Baak found himself explaining to
park rangers more than once why a minivan filled with inscrutable
equipment was idling in front of the national park lodge for hours on
end. But the effort paid off. When the family returned to the suburbs
two days later, the cesium clocks were off by the precise amount
relativity predicted. He and his family had lived just a little more
life than the neighbors.

"It was the best extra 22 nanoseconds I've ever spent with the kids," Van Baak says.
