title: 'I am quickly turning into an anti-atheist atheist.'

I do not believe in God, an after-life, wood nymphs, or anything else that hasn't been proven by science.  It's just easier.</br>

 Fr. Geoffrey Farrow 10.05.08* (Respect Life Sunday)</br>
  </br>
 As most of you know, I was appointed pastor here at the Newman Center</br>
 on April 15th of this year. When I arrived, I set out to address a</br>
 series of various projects to repair our facilities. To date, most of</br>
 these deferred maintenance items have been addressed. In the middle of</br>
 dealing with contractors, the parish finance committee, the building</br>
 department of the diocese, neighbors, etc., I received a FAX from the</br>
 bishop&#65533;s office on the 30th of June. It was the bishop&#65533;s pastoral</br>
 letter for the month of July.</br>
  </br>
 This single FAX threw my whole summer, and in fact, my whole life into</br>
 a turmoil. Recently, I was speaking with some of our parishioners who</br>
 advocate for the ordination of women. In the course of our</br>
 conversation, a question arose which has haunted me: "At what point do</br>
 you cease to be an agent for healing and growth and become an</br>
 accomplice of injustice?" </br>
  </br>
 By asking all of the pastors of the Diocese of Fresno to promote</br>
 Catholics to vote "Yes" on Proposition 8, the bishop has placed me in a</br>
 moral predicament.</br>
  </br>
 In his "Pastoral," the bishop states: "Marriage is much more than</br>
 simply two persons loving each other. Marriage is naturally, socially,</br>
 and biologically, directed to bringing forth life."</br>
  </br>
 Actually, there are TWO ends to marriage: 1) Unitive and 2)</br>
 Procreative. The unitive end of marriage is simply a union of love and</br>
 life. The Procreative end is, of course, to create new life. It is</br>
 important to understand that the unitive end of marriage is sufficient</br>
 for a valid marriage. The Church sanctions, and considers a sacrament,</br>
 the marriage of elderly heterosexual couples who are biologically</br>
 incapable of reproduction. So, if two people of different genders who</br>
 are incapable of reproduction can enter into a valid marriage, then why</br>
 is that two people of the same gender, who are incapable of</br>
 reproduction, cannot enter into a valid marriage.</br>
  </br>
 The objections which are raised at this point are taken from Sacred</br>
 Scripture. Scripture scholars reveal the problematic nature of</br>
 attempting to use passages from the Hebrew Scriptures as an argument</br>
 against same gender relationships. Essentially, these scriptures are</br>
 addressing the cultic practices in which sex with temple prostitutes</br>
 was part of an act of worshiping Pagan gods. With regard to the Pauline</br>
 epistles, John J. McNeill, in his book: "The Church and the</br>
 Homosexual,"  makes the following point: "The persons referred to in</br>
 Romans 1:26 are probably not homosexuals that is, those who are</br>
 psychologically inclined toward their own sex-since they are portrayed</br>
 as &#65533;abandoning their natural customs.&#65533;" The Pauline epistles do not</br>
 explicitly treat the question of homosexual activity between two</br>
 persons who share a homosexual orientation, and as such cannot be read</br>
 as explicitly condemning such behavior. Therefore, same gender sex by</br>
 two individuals with same sex orientation is not "abandoning their</br>
 natural custom."</br>
  </br>
 In 1973, as a result of a greater understanding of human psychology,</br>
 the American Psychological Association declassified homosexuality as a</br>
 mental illness. In 1975, the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of</br>
 the Faith (the Church&#65533;s watchdog for orthodoxy) produced a document</br>
 entitled: "Declaration on Certain Questions Concerning Sexual Ethics." </br>
  </br>
 In this document, they made the most remarkable statement. They stated</br>
 that there are "homosexuals who are such because of some kind of</br>
 innate instinct." While these statements are hardly glowing</br>
 affirmations of gay and lesbian persons, they represent a watershed in</br>
 human perception and understanding of gay and lesbian people.</br>
  </br>
 These new insights have occurred as a result of the birth and</br>
 development of the science of psychology and understanding of brain</br>
 development in the 19th and 20th centuries. The California Supreme</br>
 Court cited and quoted an amicus brief filed by the APA in the Court&#65533;s</br>
 opinion issued on May 15, 2008 that struck down California&#65533;s ban on</br>
 same sex marriage. Specifically, the court relied on the APA&#65533;s brief in</br>
 concluding that the very nature of sexual orientation is related to</br>
 the gender of partners to whom one is attracted, so that prohibiting</br>
 same sex marriage discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation,</br>
 rather than just imposing disparate burdens on gay people.</br>
  </br>
 In directing the faithful to vote "Yes" on Proposition 8, the</br>
 California Bishops are not merely entering the political arena, they</br>
 are ignoring the advances and insights of neurology, psychology and the</br>
 very statements made by the Church itself that homosexuality is innate</br>
 (i.e. orientation). In doing this, they are making a statement which</br>
 has a direct, and damaging, effect on some of the people who may be</br>
 sitting in the pews next to you today. The statement made by the bishop</br>
 reaffirms the feelings of exclusion and alienation that are suffered</br>
 by individuals and their loved ones who have left the Church over this</br>
 very issue. Imagine what hearing such damaging words at Mass does to an</br>
 adolescent who has just discovered that he/she is gay/lesbian? What is</br>
 the hierarchy saying to him/her? What are they demanding from that</br>
 individual? What would it have meant to you personally to hear from the</br>
 pulpit at church that you could never date? Never fall in love,</br>
 never kiss or hold hands with another person? Never be able to marry?</br>
 How would you view yourself? How would others hearing those same words</br>
 be directed to view you? How would you view your life and your future?</br>
 How would you feel when you saw a car with a "Yes on 8" bumper sticker?</br>
 When you overheard someone in a public place use the word "faggot?"</br>
  </br>
 I remember the first time I heard that word, faggot, I was hanging out</br>
 with my cousins. They all played on the football team of the Catholic</br>
 high school in our town. One of them spat out the word in the form of a</br>
 curse. I was just a kid in the 5th grade, I&#65533;d never heard the word</br>
 before, and so I asked: "What&#65533;s a faggot?" A faggot is a guy who likes</br>
 other guys, was the curt reply. Now pause. Think. What would those</br>
 words mean to someone in junior high school who discovers that he/she</br>
 is attracted to people of their same gender? The greatest fear that</br>
 he/she would have is that they would be rejected by the people they</br>
 love the most-their family. So, their solution is to try to pass as</br>
 straight, deceive, and in effect-lie. Of course, this leads ultimately</br>
 to self loathing. It should come as little surprise that gay teenagers</br>
 have elevated suicide rates. According to the Center for Disease</br>
 Control&#65533;s Youth Risk Behavior Survey (1999), 33% of gay youth will</br>
 attempt suicide.</br>
  </br>
 The bishop states: "The Church has spoken out constantly that those</br>
 with a homosexual orientation must be respected with the dignity of</br>
 every child of God. Every individual is created in the image and</br>
 likeness of God and should never be subjected to prejudice or hatred." </br>
 A pious thought uttered by a cleric, robbed of any substantive</br>
 meaning, as the executioner begins his work. Only a few select people</br>
 actually read those documents. What most Catholics hear about being gay</br>
 or lesbian at their parish church is silence. A numbing silence, which</br>
 slowly and insidiously tells them, "You don&#65533;t belong here, this is not</br>
 for you, and you are not welcome." It is not the crude overt vulgarity</br>
 of some churches. But rather, it is the coldness of a maitre d&#65533; who</br>
 simply won&#65533;t seat you, or the club which has put you on a waiting list</br>
 with no intention of allowing you to join. And simply asks you to wait</br>
 in polite almost, apologetic tones.</br>
  </br>
 In effect, the bishops are asking gay and lesbian people to live their</br>
 lives alone. Why? Who does this benefit? How exactly is society helped</br>
 by singling out a minority and excluding them from the union of love</br>
 and life, which is marriage? How is marriage protected by intimidating</br>
 gay and lesbian people into loveless and lonely lives? What is</br>
 accomplished by this? Worse still, is to intimidate a gay or lesbian</br>
 person into a heterosexual marriage, which is doomed from its</br>
 inception, and makes two victims instead of one by this hurtful</br>
 "theology." This "theology," which is parroted by clerics in polished</br>
 tones from pulpits, produces the very prejudice and hatred in our</br>
 society which they claim to abhor.</br>
  </br>
 When the hierarchy prohibited artificial birth control, most of the</br>
 faithful in the United States, Canada and Europe scratched their heads</br>
 in wonderment and proceeded to ignore them. There is an expression in</br>
 theology: "the voice of the people is the voice of God." If your son or</br>
 daughter is gay/lesbian let them know that you love them</br>
 unconditionally. Let them know that you are not ashamed or embarrassed</br>
 by them. Guide them as you would your other children to finding true</br>
 and abiding love. Let them know that marriage is a union of love and</br>
 life and is possible for them too.</br>
  </br>
 I do not presume to tell you how to vote but I do ask that you pray to</br>
 the Creator of us all. Think and consider the effects of your vote on</br>
 others, especially minorities in our society who are sitting next to</br>
 you in church, and at work. The act of casting a vote takes you a few</br>
 minutes but it can cause other human beings untold happiness or sorrow</br>
 for a lifetime. It can grant them hope and acceptance, or it can cause</br>
 them to lose civil rights. It can be a rebuff to bigotry and hatred, or</br>
 it can encourage bigotry and hatred. Personally, I am morally</br>
 compelled to vote "NO" on Proposition 8. It is my hope that the people</br>
 of California will join with those others around the world such as</br>
 Canada, Europe and South Africa who welcome their gay and lesbian</br>
 family members fully into society by granting them the civil right to</br>
 marry.</br>
  </br>
 I know these words of truth will cost me dearly. But to withhold them,</br>
 would be far more costly and I would become an accomplice to a moral</br>
 evil that strips gay and lesbian people not only of their civil rights</br>
 but of their human dignity as well. Jesus said, "The truth will set you</br>
 free." He didn&#65533;t promise that it would be easy or without personal</br>
 cost to speak that truth.</br>
