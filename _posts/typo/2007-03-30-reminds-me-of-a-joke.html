<br />Q: How many U2 members does it take to screw in a lightbulb?<br /><br />A:&nbsp; One.&nbsp; Bono holds the lightbulb motionless, and the world revolves around him.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/arts/AP-People-Bono.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">Bono Becomes Knight of the British Empire - New York Times</a> <br /> <blockquote>"You have permission to call me anything you want -- except sir, all right? Lord of lords, your demigodness, that'll do," he told reporters afterward.<br />Because he is an Irish citizen, Bono won't have the title of "sir" before his name. <br /><br />[...]<br /><p>Reddaway paid tribute to Bono's work as a campaigner against poverty
and disease in Africa -- but first asked whether he was disappointed
that becoming a knight no longer involves a sword or kneeling. </p><p>"Please, I wasn't expecting you to kneel," said Bono, his hand on the ambassador's shoulder. </p><br /></blockquote>
