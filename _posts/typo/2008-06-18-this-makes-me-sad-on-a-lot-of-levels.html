title: 'This makes me sad on a lot of levels'

Number 1, and least consequential, it makes me feel old.&nbsp; When I lived in Somalia, they had an effective central Government.&nbsp; Not fair, not just, but effective.&nbsp; Number 2:&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp;&nbsp; The last time the Somalis had an effective government, the Cold War was still on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Younger folk (like <a href="http://www.thedustyfoot.com/">K'Na'an</a>, an amazing hiphop artist), don't even remember a time when Somalia had a government, and have lived their whole lives in conditions too atrocious to comprehend.&nbsp; 

My mother worked there a few years back, as a Red Cross hospital administrator.&nbsp; When she saw two people shot in a hospital Mogadishu, she asked what happened, and the local administrator said:&nbsp; "They were just walking down the street, and got caught in a gun battle, it happens every day"

Every day.&nbsp; 17 years.&nbsp; Damnit.
