title: 'Echinacea proven useless, again.'
---
This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/28/health/28cold.html?incamp=article_popular">NY Times article</a> talks about a study that once again, and in new ways, refutes any claims to a cold remedy.</br>
</br>
Some cool quotes.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<blockquote>  The study, being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine,</br>
 involved 437 people who volunteered to have cold viruses dripped into their</br>
 noses. Some swallowed echinacea for a week beforehand, others a placebo.</br>
 Still others took echinacea or a placebo at the time they were infected.</br>
</br>
 Then the subjects were secluded in hotel rooms for five days while</br>
 scientists examined them for symptoms and took nasal washings to look for</br>
 the virus and for an immune system protein, interleukin-8. Some had</br>
 hypothesized that interleukin-8 was stimulated by echinacea, enabling the</br>
 herb to stop colds.</br>
</br>
 But the investigators found that those who took echinacea fared no</br>
 differently from those who took a placebo: they were just as likely to</br>
 catch a cold, their symptoms were just as severe, they had just as much</br>
 virus in their nasal secretions, and they made no more interleukin-8.</br>
</blockquote></br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
<blockquote> Now, with increasing evidence that echinacea does not work for colds,</br>
 scientists are confronting a problem, Dr. Sampson said, in that "there is</br>
 no 'demarcation of the absurd,' a point at which it is unwise to pursue an</br>
 investigation further."</br>
</br>
 For Dr. Turner, that point is here.</br>
</br>
 "We should assume that echinacea does not work until somebody proves it</br>
 does," he said. That, he added, "is the flip side of where we've been."</br>
</br>
</br>
</blockquote></br>
