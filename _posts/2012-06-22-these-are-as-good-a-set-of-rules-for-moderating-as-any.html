title: 'These are as good a set of rules for moderating as any other.'

<p>Lately though we’ve adopted some totally random rules to cut down on the sheer volume. If your IP address has “23″ in it we immediately delete w/o reading. If your wordpress handle has “girl” or “free” or “media” or “Tech” we delete immediately. If you start with foul language or are extra angry we delete. Unless of course we want you to look stupid then we publish your comments. Today we searched for all comments that contained the words “market” “zero” or ”marginal” and bulk deleted. This was specifically cause we don’t really want to explain that fixed costs really do matter and no matter what you heard from some idiot on the internet. If you play bass we delete. Also “”McPherson”: bulk delete. The use of the words “consumer” , “ointment” , “dude”, “gatekeepers” and “dubstep” also resulted in a fair number of deletions. We are only joking about some of this. If you feel that this somehow infringes your freedom you have the whole free internet out there to express we’ve infringed your freedom.</p>
