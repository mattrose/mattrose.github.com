Somewhere in there, say 14 or 15 years in, I had so much bike knowledge, and, thanks to all those years of riding everything from $300 to $10,000 bikes week after week, I had so much knowledge of so many bikes that if someone wanted to know why a bike steered the way it did, I could finally give an answer that those old mentors of mine wouldn’t have been able to refute or even expand upon. I knew it all. And that is the high point of any sort of knowledge or pursuit from which, of course, if you’re lucky and persistent, you find out you know practically nothing. You finally get up high enough to get a clear view of how much more there is out there to know. It’s humbling.
