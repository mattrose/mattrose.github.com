title: 'This is a fantastic and beautiful track, davey. flecton:  malenursesongs:  male nurse - 349 - the power won’t be staying on for long (arrivals) i put a hell of a lot of work into this one. probably my favorite song of the year, so i wanted to do it justice. i also added some kanye-esque (my other favorite of the year) distorted auto tune vocals. whatever. i’m happy with it. here are the lyrics, because they are great. i used to stand so firm with little givelike a sky scrapernow i’m flash paperi used to think i knew how we could livebut now everything’s a questionslight of handand misdirectionnow i seethe forest for the treesit’s timber falling down without a soundtalk to your mother cuz the power won’t be staying on for longi used to think that life was what it seemedwith our time stablewith our minds ablewe digitize the beauty that we dreamnow our generation’s historyfloats like ghosts in my periphery now i seethe forest for the treesit’s timber falling down without a soundtalk to your brother cuz the power won’t be staying on for long  i agree. this is a great tune man.
