<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how the fight has moved from &#8220;Wind and solar are pipe dreams&#8221; to &#8220;Well they can generate some power, but not all&#8221; which is also false</p>

<p>Wind can be a replacement, and, with a good transmission system, makes a better baseload generation system (Think:  the wind may not always blow, but is the whole province ever wind-free?) than any gas or nuclear.</p>

<p>With respect to complexity and work.  Doing that math, wind power is *far* less than half the price per installed MW, and at a year over year average of 50-75% peak capacity, actually still works out cheaper per running watt-hour than nuclear.</p>

<p>That does not even factor in the cost of Waste disposal, (estimated at at least $24 million), or liability costs in case something goes wrong.  Ontario&#8217;s nuke plants regularly leak tritium into the Great Lakes. </p>
