<p>Tim,</p>
<p>Just because you can string an apologetic sentence together does not  mean you are sorry.  Perhaps I should make you aware of the consequences  of your action.  To you, it’s just an overturned car that you set on  fire. To me, it’s walking into an overflowing ER and helping treat a  girl with a severe asthma attack because she was exposed to the noxious,  acrid smoke of a burning vehicle.  To her,  it was just a chance to be a  part of a group cheering for her team. Little did she know that later  on, we were thinking of sticking a breathing tube down her throat if her  condition did not improve.</p>
<p>To you (yes, I am lumping you with all the  douchebag rioters in the ER that night), it’s a chance to congregate in  the ER waiting room, pounding on the triage window demanding to be seen  for teargas exposure and cuts from looting and fighting, while posturing  and bragging about how you kicked the crap out of somebody and smashed  shit up.  To me, it’s taking my time away from the little old quiet lady  having chest pain or taking time away from the person you “shit-kicked”  for trying to stop the looting.</p>
<p>To you, it’s just a fight. To me, it’s  the ER social worker looking for a teddybear to console a 4 year old girl  because she just witnessed her dad get a broken nose as he was trying to  get his daughter out of the hotzone.</p>
<p>To you, it’s writing a letter  saying “you will do whatever it takes to help clean the city.” To me, it’s  walking home after a long shift and seeing all these people at 7:30 in  the morning armed with garbage bags cleaning up YOUR mess and realizing  that these people have more class in their pinky finger than you could  ever muster in your whole life.</p>
<p>To me, it’s getting home to shower, only  to have my elderly neighbour knock on my door and ask me if he should  make an appointment to this doctor because he was experiencing shortness  of breath which later turned to chest pain in the morning. He did not  think about leaving his window open as he went to bed at 9 o’clock.  The  smoke from all the burning cars made it to our building, into his room  and triggered his asthma, which then raised his heart rate, which then  became a small heart attack.  I asked him why he didn’t go to the ER,  and he answered, “I turned on the tv this morning and saw the rioting, I  did not want to be a burden.” To you, it’s just an overturned car that  you set on fire.</p>
<p>Why am I blaming you for all this? Because you are the instigator.   You ask people to leave your family, friends and co-workers alone?! I  think they need to know how much of a colossal douche you are.  Remember  that your parents worked themselves to the bone so they can move to  this country and give you your god-given right to flip cars over and set  them on fire.</p>
<p>You, Tim Kwong, are a douchtard. Apology not accepted.</p>
