<p>Frankly, the professional experience I have had with TSA has frightened me. Once, when approaching screening for a flight on official FBI business, I showed my badge as I had done for decades in order to bypass screening. (You can be envious, but remember, I was one less person in line.) I was asked for my form which showed that I was armed. I was unarmed on this flight because my ultimate destination was a foreign country. I was told, &#8220;Then you have to be screened.&#8221; This logic startled me, so I asked, &#8220;If I tell you I have a high-powered weapon, you will let me bypass screening, but if I tell you I&#8217;m unarmed, then I have to be screened?&#8221; The answer? &#8220;Yes. Exactly.&#8221; Another time, I was bypassing screening (again on official FBI business) with my .40 caliber semi-automatic pistol, and a TSA officer noticed the clip of my pocket knife. &#8220;You can&#8217;t bring a knife on board,&#8221; he said. I looked at him incredulously and asked, &#8220;The semi-automatic pistol is okay, but you don&#8217;t trust me with a knife?&#8221; His response was equal parts predictable and frightening, &#8220;But knives are not allowed on the planes.&#8221;</p>
