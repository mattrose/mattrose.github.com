<blockquote>
<p>The first decade of the 21st century was a crazy bookend to the twentieth, opening with a second Pearl Harbor and ending with a second Great Crash, with a second Vietnam wedged in between.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The parallels are not exact, but damn that is a good summation of the first decade of the 21st century.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> found another good quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> This isn’t conservatism; it’s a going-out-of-business sale for the baby-boom generation.</p>
