<a href="http://www.rdio.com/#/artist/Ani_DiFranco/album/Not_A_Pretty_Girl/">Ani DiFranco - Not A Pretty Girl - Rdio</a><br/><p>Not sure if this is objective, or some kind of Dan Levitin neurological imperative, but so far in the Ani Difranco back catalog, this is my favourite album.  Displays a musical complexity that wasn&#8217;t there in earlier albums.  </p>
<p>However, this could just be that this was my first Ani Difranco record, and the first time I saw her was when she was on tour promoting this one. </p>
