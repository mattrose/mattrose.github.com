<p>Checking my email this morning, I thought; &#8220;Why am I getting a <a href="http://chevron-press.com/article/Radical-Chevron-Ad-Campaign-Highlights-Industry-Problems/" target="_blank">press release from Chevron</a>&#8221;  Curious, I continued to read it, and realized what was going on&#8230;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how I got on the Yes Men&#8217;s mailing list, I think it has to do with my online involvement with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nettime" target="_blank">bunch of Slovenian artists/anarchists</a>, but it&#8217;s provided me with advance warning of hoaxes for years now.  My most recent fave was when I got a <a href="http://theyesmen.org/content/canadian-announcement" target="_blank">press release from Environment Canada</a> saying that Canada would pay up to 5% of it&#8217;s GDP to countries affected by it&#8217;s past environmental policy</p>

<p>What constantly amazes me is how many legitimate media organizations get taken in by what is obviously satire, and even more amazingly <a href="http://theyesmen.org/etc/chevron/chevron-fastcompany-chevrons-new-ad-campaign-makes-lemonade.html" target="_blank">print it</a></p>
