title: "Five cyclists set out on a morning ride from Kanata, Ontario to Pakenham and back. Three miles into their ride, Luangpakham drifted into the bicycle lane. He hit one of the cyclists. And then another. And another. And another. And another. He hit all five cyclists, and continued driving. Luangpakham\xE2\x80\x99s excuse? He thought he had hit a pole."
