<p>His entire column is good, but the last 2 paragraphs are, or at least should be, a punch in the gut to anyone who thinks that Parliamentary processes are archaic niceties, or for that matter, that the Conservatives care about how taxpayer money is spent. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Had Parliament been given the costing information it demanded, we might have been in a better position to judge who was right, the government or its critics — before the last election, not after. Remember, it was the government&#8217;s refusal to provide just this information that was, in part, the reason for the motion of no-confidence that precipitated the election.</p>
<p>So this is also what comes of Parliament&#8217;s prerogatives, its powers to hold ministers to account, being ignored or overridden. These aren&#8217;t procedural niceties, of concern only to constitutional law professors — &#8220;process issues,&#8221; as more than one member of the press gallery sneered at the time. They&#8217;re the vital bulwarks of self-government, the only means we have of ensuring our wishes are obeyed and our money isn&#8217;t wasted.</p>
