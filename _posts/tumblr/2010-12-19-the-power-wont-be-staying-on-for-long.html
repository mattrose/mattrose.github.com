<p>male nurse - 349 - the power won’t be staying on for long (arrivals)</p>
<p>i put a hell of a lot of work into this one. probably my favorite song of the year, so i wanted to do it justice. i also added some kanye-esque (my other favorite of the year) distorted auto tune vocals. whatever. i’m happy with it. here are the lyrics, because they are great.</p>
<p>i used to stand so firm with little give<br/>like a sky scraper<br/>now i’m flash paper<br/><br/>i used to think i knew how we could live<br/>but now everything’s a question<br/>slight of hand<br/>and misdirection<br/><br/>now i see<br/>the forest for the trees<br/>it’s timber falling down without a sound<br/>talk to your mother cuz the power won’t be staying on for long<br/><br/>i used to think that life was what it seemed<br/>with our time stable<br/>with our minds able<br/><br/>we digitize the beauty that we dream<br/>now our generation’s history<br/>floats like ghosts in my periphery <br/><br/>now i see<br/>the forest for the trees<br/>it’s timber falling down without a sound<br/>talk to your brother cuz the power won’t be staying on for long</p>
