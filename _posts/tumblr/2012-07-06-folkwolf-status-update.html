title: Folkwolf Status Update
tags:

<p><em><strong>UPDATE: </strong></em>The resize is now complete and everything should be running as normal.</p>
<p>Those that use the folkwolf have forced me to take drastic measures, and move the folkwolf from a super-cheap rackspace instance to a slightly less super-cheap rackspace instance.</p>
<p>Double the RAM and disk-space.  It&#8217;s migrating over now so it&#8217;ll be down for a while.  Not sure how long but I wouldn&#8217;t touch it for an hour or two</p>
