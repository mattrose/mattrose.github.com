title: The Frenchman admitted that he almost didn’t touch his bike during the week
  preceding the start in Vendée, as he became a dad for the second time three days
  before stage 1. He also realised during stage 17 that it’s worth going to reconnoiter
  the crucial stages in advance. Before the Dauphiné, he told Cyclingnews that he
  wasn’t a fan of training camps in the mountains but his new status as a GC contender
  has made him change his mind.
