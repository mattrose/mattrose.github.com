<a href="http://rrj.ca/m11740/">140 Characters in Search of a Story </a><br/><p>good article on @kady and @wicary and @davidakin.  I live in Ottawa, 4 blocks from Parliament Hill, but I&#8217;m completely outside &#8220;the bubble&#8221;  I have one friend from high school in the PCO, but he tries as hard as he can to stay outside &#8220;the bubble&#8221;  Following people like Kady O&#8217;Malley and Rosemarie Barton lets me know about what happens in &#8220;the other Ottawa&#8221;</p>
