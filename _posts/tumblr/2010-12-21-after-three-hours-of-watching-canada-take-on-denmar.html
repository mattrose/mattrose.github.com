title: After three hours of watching Canada take on Denmark in women’s curling Friday,
  regulars at the Cargo Grill in suburban Pennsylvania felt they had the rules and
  traditions of the sport sufficiently sussed out. “We basically think it’s like horseshoes
  but with ice,” bar patron Jim Comito said of the 500-year old sport. “The middle
  part of the bull’s-eye thing is worth two points unless they both get their pot-looking
  thing in the middle. Tommy said they use the brooms to clear little ice particles
  out of the way, but I still think it’s a static electricity thing.” By the tenth
  end, the entire bar felt they had enough information at their disposal to chant
  “Curl! Curl! Curl!” at the television.
