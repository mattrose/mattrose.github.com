title: the gamification back-backlash

<p>I started thinking about this because of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dings/pawned-gamification-and-its-discontents" target="_blank">this slideshow</a>, and <a href="http://folkwolf.tumblr.com/post/1408869637/the-gamification-of-everything" target="_blank">this video</a>.  Not to mention @jeffreymcmanus&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jeffreymcmanus/status/1749364116561920" target="_blank">complete disdain</a> for the slideshow.  I later learned that part of the reason for his disdain is that he (very much unlike me) actually does stuff with his talents, and has <a href="http://codelesson.com/" target="_blank">a startup</a> that is <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jeffreymcmanus/status/1752641398902784" target="_blank">actively using</a> these very techniques <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jeffreymcmanus/status/1767749252550657" target="_blank">successfully</a>.  He even, like me (but better, of course), wrote a <a href="http://blog.codelesson.com/why-we-have-achievements-and-badges/" target="_blank">longer, well-reasoned essay</a> on why he was using these gamification accoutrement for Codelesson.</p>
<p>I got to thinking about what badges mean.  In the best cases, badges are meant to outwardly reflect achievements that may not be otherwise reflected The backlash against gamification   In Codelesson&#8217;s case, the Badges are an advertisement, not only for Codelesson, but an advertisement of the individual&#8217;s knowledge.  As Jeffrey puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nobody’s going to hire you on the basis of whether you have unlocked the RateItAll stamp on Gowalla, but it might be possible to get a job after getting the WordPress Wrangler badge on CodeLesson.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At their best, badges should externally represent knowledge of someone that would otherwise only be known, either by the system or by long-standing participants in the community.   </p>
