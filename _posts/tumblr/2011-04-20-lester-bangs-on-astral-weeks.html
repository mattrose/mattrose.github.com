<a href="http://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/~murray/astral.html">Lester Bangs on "Astral Weeks"</a><br/><p>I just like &#8220;there it is and it feels right, but I can&#8217;t say for sure what it means.&#8221; Â The rest is there for context.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not surprised that people get different meanings out of my songs,&#8221; he told a Rolling Stone interviewer. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t wanna give the impression that I know what everything means &#8216;cause I don&#8217;t&#8230; . There are times when I&#8217;m mystified. I look at some of the stuff that comes out, y&#8217;know. And like, there it is and it feels right, but I can&#8217;t say for sure what it means.&#8221;</p>
