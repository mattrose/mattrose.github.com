<p>This year&#8217;s GOP candidates are a bumper crop of stupid.  <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/06/10/241830/top-10-thing-texas-gov-rick-perry/" target="_blank">Rick Perry</a>, <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/michele-bachmanns-holy-war-20110622" target="_blank">Michelle Bachmann</a>, and perennial libertarian outsider, Ron Paul</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We should be like 1900; we should be like 1940, 1950, 1960,” Paul said. “I live on the gulf coast, we deal with hurricanes all the time. Galveston is in my district.</p>
<p>“There’s no magic about FEMA. They’re a great contribution to deficit financing and quite frankly they don’t have a penny in the bank. We should be coordinated but coordinated voluntarily with the states,” Paul told NBC News. “A state can decide. We don’t need somebody in Washington.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The dead bodies were so numerous that burying them all was not possible. The dead were initially weighted down and dumped at sea, but when the gulf currents washed many of the bodies back onto the beach, a new solution was needed.[27] Funeral pyres were set up wherever the dead were found and burned for weeks after the storm. The authorities passed out free whiskey to sustain the distraught men conscripted for the gruesome work of collecting and burning the dead.[17] More people were killed in this single storm than the total of those killed in all the tropical cyclones that have struck the United States since.</p>
