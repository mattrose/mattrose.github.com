title: Then Dr. Thompson asked the cyclists to race against an avatar, a figure of
  a cyclist on a computer screen in front them. Each rider was shown two avatars.
  One was himself, moving along a virtual course at the rate he was actually pedaling
  the stationary bicycle. The other figure was moving at the pace of the cyclist’s
  own best effort — or so the cyclists were told. In fact, the second avatar was programmed
  to ride faster than the cyclist ever had — using 2 percent more power, which translates
  into a 1 percent increase in speed. Told to race against what they thought was their
  own best time, the cyclists ended up matching their avatars on their virtual rides,
  going significantly faster than they ever had gone before.
