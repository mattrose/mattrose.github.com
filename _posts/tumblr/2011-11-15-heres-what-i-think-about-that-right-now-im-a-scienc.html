title: ! 'Here’s what I think about that, right now. I’m a science fiction writer,
  and one of the great stories of science fiction is “The Ones Who Walk Away From
  Omelas,” which was written by Ursula K. Le Guin. The story posits a fantastic utopian
  city, where everything is beautiful, with one catch: In order for all this comfort
  and beauty to exist, one child must be kept in filth and misery. Every citizen of
  Omelas, when they come of age, is told about that one blameless child being put
  through hell. And they have a choice: Accept that is the price for their perfect
  lives in Omelas, or walk away from that paradise, into uncertainty and possibly
  chaos.


  At Pennsylvania State University, a grown man found a blameless child being put
  through hell. Other grown men learned of it. Each of them had to make their choice,
  and decide, fundamentally, whether the continuation of their utopia — or at very
  least the illusion of their utopia — was worth the pain and suffering of that one
  child. Through their actions, and their inactions, we know the choice they made.'
