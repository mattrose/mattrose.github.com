title: Now I’m wondering if I avoided ‘The Wire’ because its central themes — drugs,
  corruption, urban decay — were realities that I simply wanted to ignore. Instead
  of being haunted by a show like this, it was easier and safer to skip it entirely.
  Most people feel this way, I’m guessing; it’s the only conceivable reason why five
  times as many people would watch “The Sopranos” instead of a show that’s better
  in every way. See, when most Americans dabble in inner-city TV shows or movies for
  our ‘taste’ of street life, we’re hoping for the Hollywood version. We don’t want
  despair and decay, we want hope and triumph. We don’t want the zero-sum game of
  drug dealers killing each other, we want The Rock coaching juvie kids and turning
  their lives around in two hours. We want them to win the big football game, we want
  the movie to end, and we don’t want to think about these people ever again.
