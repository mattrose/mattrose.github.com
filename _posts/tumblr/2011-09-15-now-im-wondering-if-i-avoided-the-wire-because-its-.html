Instead of being haunted by a show like this, it was easier and safer to skip it entirely. Most people feel this way, I\xE2\x80\x99m guessing; it\xE2\x80\x99s the only conceivable reason why five times as many people would watch \xE2\x80\x9CThe Sopranos\xE2\x80\x9D instead of a show that\xE2\x80\x99s better in every way. See, when most Americans dabble in inner-city TV shows or movies for our \xE2\x80\x98taste\xE2\x80\x99 of street life, we\xE2\x80\x99re hoping for the Hollywood version. We don\xE2\x80\x99t want despair and decay, we want hope and triumph. We don\xE2\x80\x99t want the zero-sum game of drug dealers killing each other, we want The Rock coaching juvie kids and turning their lives around in two hours. We want them to win the big football game, we want the movie to end, and we don\xE2\x80\x99t want to think about these people ever again."
