<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/sports/hockey/derek-boogaard-a-boy-learns-to-brawl.html">Hockey</a><br/><p>A damning series of articles in the NYTimes about Derek Boogerd, a hockey enforcer who committed suicide, most likely due to side effects of CTE, and drug addiction.  A compelling picture, not only of the culture of violence that pervades pro hockey, and the costs that are borne by the enforcers, but also a moving picture of a kid growing up in Saskatchewan with a dream of playing in the NHL </p>
