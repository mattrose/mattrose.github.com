title: I was in a break once in a little race here in Pennsylvania with two riders
  from one team and two from another, and I was friendly with all four - and knew
  they were all better than me. I said, ‘I know I can’t win and I’m not going to work
  with any of you, so I’m just going to attack over and over until I blow up.’ And,
  you know, that was pretty fun. It made the last laps exciting. I don’t think those
  sorts of textured experiences exist in zero-sum sports.
