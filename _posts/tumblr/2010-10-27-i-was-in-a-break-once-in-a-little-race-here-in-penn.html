title: "I was in a break once in a little race here in Pennsylvania with two riders from one team and two from another, and I was friendly with all four - and knew they were all better than me. I said, \xE2\x80\x98I know I can\xE2\x80\x99t win and I\xE2\x80\x99m not going to work with any of you, so I\xE2\x80\x99m just going to attack over and over until I blow up.\xE2\x80\x99 And, you know, that was pretty fun. It made the last laps exciting. I don\xE2\x80\x99t think those sorts of textured experiences exist in zero-sum sports."
