<p>listening to <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/q/blog/2011/11/01/is-there-a-moral-obligation-to-come-out/" target="_blank">CBC&#8217;s Q on the radio tuesday night</a>.  In particular, this discussion between a Globe&amp;Mail editorial writer <span>Karim Bardeesy</span> and (I have to quote this) &#8220;Head of the University of Toronto&#8217;s Mark Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies&#8221; Brenda Cossman</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve probably seen <a href="http://youtu.be/J1OvtBa2FK8" target="_blank">this rant by Rick Mercer</a>.  If you haven&#8217;t go watch it now.  I&#8217;m not gay, but it resonated with me.  It reminded of  <a href="http://youtu.be/Pvfexvihri8" target="_blank">a great speech by Harvey Milk</a> about how it&#8217;s easy it is to demonize gay people when you don&#8217;t know any, but when you realize that your friends and neighbours are gay, it becomes harder and harder.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/editorials/no-rick-mercer-not-all-gay-public-figures-need-to-step-forward/article2216358/" target="_blank">The Globe and Mail editorial</a> was in response to the Rick Mercer Rant, saying that calling on gay people to come out is a moral obligation too far.  People in public life have to sacrifice so much, we should be able to respect this one privacy.  Not a position I agree with, but not a wholly unreasonable one either.</p>
<p>If you want to get caught up, and really understand, I recommend reading all the material above.</p>
<p>In the Rick Mercer rant, he specifically mentions &#8220;Cabinet Ministers&#8221; in the litany of types of gay people he knows.  That caught me, because I don&#8217;t know of any openly gay Cabinet Ministers. </p>
<p>In the Q discussion, Karim Bardeesy talks specifically about the risks of coming out to hypothetical Conservative Party politicians.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve been getting more and more frustrated, because they keep dancing around the<a href="http://www.xtra.ca/public/National/So_much_for_John_Bairds_reputation_as_a_gutsy_brawler-8197.aspx" target="_blank"> not-so-openly gay John Baird</a>.  Nobody even mentions his name, and the multiple times he&#8217;s been outed.  Nope, they keep dancing around the issue.  It seems to be what everyone is referring to, but nobody is mentioning it by name.  </p>
<p>Baird even appears in the <a href="http://%22it%20gets%20better%22%20video" target="_blank">&#8220;it gets better&#8221; video</a> that the Conservative Party put out, but he didn&#8217;t say it then, when it really mattered.  </p>
<p>I think what really frustrates me is that this should not be an issue, but it is.</p>
