  mad, and I got defiant. If they were going to keep blowing past me, then I was going
  to get out into the lane and make it impossible. So I came out about a metre into
  the lane - where, technically, I should be, but way further out than I usually ride
  - and I stayed there, determinedly ignoring the sounds of cars coming up from behind
  me. Or at least, not ignoring them, but not letting them push me sideways. I was
  absolutely done with being intimidated by cars.'
