<p>He&#8217;s trying to make the point that the only path to success in the software industry is to work insane hours, sleep under your desk, and give up your one and only youth, and if you don&#8217;t do that, you&#8217;re a pussy. He&#8217;s using my words to try and back up that thesis.</p>

<p>I hate this, because it&#8217;s not true, and it&#8217;s disingenuous.</p>

<p>What is true is that for a VC&#8217;s business model to work, it&#8217;s necessary for you to give up your life in order for him to become richer.</p>

<p>Follow the fucking money. When a VC tells you what&#8217;s good for you, check your wallet, then count your fingers.</p>
