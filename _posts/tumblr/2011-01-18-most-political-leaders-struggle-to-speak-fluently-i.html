<blockquote>Most political leaders struggle to speak fluently in a foreign tongue. Only the exceptional manage to mangle their own.</blockquote>&#8212;<p>Nicolas Sarkozy is adopting a more presidential tone after <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/17911266" target="_blank">being accused of ‘mistreating’</a> the French language. In November he nailed the fiendishly difficult imperfect subjunctive. Triple axels are easier. (via <a href="http://theeconomist.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">theeconomist</a>)</p>
<p>Sarkozy has nothing on Jean Chretien, he mangled both of Canada&#8217;s official languages with ease.</p>
