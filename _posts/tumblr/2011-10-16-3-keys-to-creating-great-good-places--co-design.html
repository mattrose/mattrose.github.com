<p>When you go hiking up in say &#8230; Gatineau Park, you need to take along food, water, and while there&#8217;s a few cabins about, they&#8217;re not really social spaces.</p>
<p>Cinqueterre on the other hand, is a fantastic hike, because you can start in the morning with a cornetto and machiato in Monterosso al Mare, do a semi difficult hike through olive groves to Vernazza, grab a panini and sit in a piazza and have lunch, do a quick hike to Corniglia, have a swim, go up the stairs for a coffee, and then have very flat, very easy stroll to Riomaggiore.</p>
