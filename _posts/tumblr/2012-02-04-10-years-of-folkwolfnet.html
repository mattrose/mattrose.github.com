<a href="http://mattrose.github.com/">10 years of Folkwolf.net</a><br/><p>I started blogging long before the term was well-known and <a href="http://www.barneystinsonblog.com/" target="_blank">on TV</a>.  It all grew out of my desire to share stuff I found online with my friends.  It started out as plain html,  just prepending stuff to a page and trying to add the date.  Since then, it&#8217;s progressed from a database-backed PHP site (wordpress), to a full on ruby on rails, to a hosted site (tumblr), and now I&#8217;m back to, pretty much, plain HTML (tho with some tech on the backend)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve consistently broken all the rules for blogging, like &#8220;focus on one topic&#8221; or &#8220;post daily&#8221; and 10 years later, I still have 0 followers.</p>
<p>Most of my early posts are gone in an HD crash from about 9 years ago, but I&#8217;m shocked how many I was able to suck out of various blog engines and hosted sites.</p>
<p>The formatting sucks, and there&#8217;s a lot of weird character translations, but, a good chunk of my life, both online and off is on this page</p>
