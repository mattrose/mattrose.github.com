title: There, the 6-inch projectile bounced in front of a home on quiet Cassata Place,
  ripped through the front door, raced up the stairs and blasted through a bedroom,
  where a man, woman and child slept through it all - only awakening because of plaster
  dust. The ball wasn’t done bouncing. It exited the house, leaving a perfectly round
  hole in the stucco, crossed six-lane Tassajara Road, took out several tiles from
  the roof of a home on Bellevue Circle and finally slammed into the Gill family’s
  beige Toyota Sienna minivan in a driveway on Springvale Drive.
