<a href="http://blogs.ottawacitizen.com/2011/11/03/god-bless-tim-hortons/">Tim Hortons to put in cappuccino makers </a><br/><p>I read about this in the paper yesterday, but I didn&#8217;t think it affected me, it took Ken Gray, a columnist I usually disagree with strongly, to connect the dots and help me realize how this was actually the best thing Tim Horton&#8217;s could do for me, personally.  Not sure how it&#8217;ll work out as a business decision </p>
