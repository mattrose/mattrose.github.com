title: Riots are always political

<p>This paragraph from some article about the UK Riots pissed me right the fuck off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Croydon is not Selma, and Tottenham is not 14th Street in the Washington, D.C., of 1968. The rioters are not fighting for a cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Repeat after me kids.  <em><strong>Riots are always politlcal.  </strong></em>Happy people do not riot.  People who are content with their lives do not decide to loot and burn down shops.  </p>
<p>People who have nothing to lose and feel disconnected from their neighbors and fellow citizens do riot.</p>
<p>This is a political problem, just because they don&#8217;t know who the PM is, doesn&#8217;t mean their aims are not political, it just means they don&#8217;t watch the news much</p>
