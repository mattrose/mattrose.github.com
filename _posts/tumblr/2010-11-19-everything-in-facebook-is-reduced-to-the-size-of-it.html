<blockquote>Everything in Facebook is reduced to the size of its founder. Blue, because it turns out Zuckerberg is red-green color-blind. “Blue is the richest color for me—I can see all of blue.” Poking, because that’s what shy boys do to girls they are scared to talk to. Preoccupied with personal trivia, because Mark Zuckerberg thinks the exchange of personal trivia is what “friendship” is.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/nov/25/generation-why/?pagination=false" target="_blank">Generation Why? by Zadie Smith | The New York Review of Books</a>
