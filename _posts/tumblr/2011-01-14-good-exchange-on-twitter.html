<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/joaoisme/statuses/25916245337440256">Good exchange on twitter</a><br/><p><em><strong>@joaoisme Joao Correia</strong></em> Walking your kid to school in NYC is sort of like leading out a sprinter. Everybody&#8217;s in a hurry and chopping you off with somebody in tow.</p>
<p>Followed by Ted King</p>
<p><em><strong>@iamtedking Ted King</strong></em> Throw elbows @joaoisme . And if you&#8217;re feeling saucy, toss a waterbottle b/t someone&#8217;s legs as you zip by.</p>
