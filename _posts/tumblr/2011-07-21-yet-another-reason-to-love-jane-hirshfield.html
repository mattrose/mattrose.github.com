title: Yet another reason to love Jane Hirshfield
tags:

<p>I may have discussed Jane Hirshfield before, she&#8217;s a Zen Buddhist Monk and poet who I was introduced to on the WeLL.  Recently a book was released <a href="http://fire-monks.com/fire-monks/" target="_blank">&#8220;Fire Monks&#8221;</a>, that describes a group of Zen Monks who fought to save the <a href="http://www.sfzc.org/tassajara/" target="_blank">Tassajara Zen retreat</a> in the hills south of Monterey, California. Jane happened to show up the day before the fire started, and she describes the experience like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for me, it was like an old war horse hearing the bugle&#8212;nostrils flare, neck arches, tail waves, even gets to trot a few steps as if young again&#8230;</p>
<p>I felt so at home under those circumstances, even while I knew that I no longer have the strength or capacity to do what I did</p>
