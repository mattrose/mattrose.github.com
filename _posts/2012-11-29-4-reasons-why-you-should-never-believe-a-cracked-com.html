title: '4 reasons why you should never believe a Cracked.com article'
---
<p>To all the people who forward me articles or retweet articles from Cracked.com, just stop.  I&#8217;m not going to look at them anymore, and I hope everyone who dreams up this drivel ends up on the street.</p>
<p><strong>1.  Linkbait</strong></p>
<p>Cracked.com is not out to inform, they&#8217;re the Howard Stern of Websites.</p>
<p><strong>2.  List-Mania</strong></p>
<p>They never actually write anything substantial just lists of &#8220;facts&#8221; designed to grab your interest</p>
<p><strong>3.  Factually Incorrect</strong></p>
<p>The &#8220;facts&#8221; that they do cite come from questionable sources, usually with an axe to grind behind the scene.</p>
<p><strong>4.  Terrible analogies</strong></p>
<p>To &#8220;dumb it down&#8221; for you, they make terrible analogies trying to illustrate their point </p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cracked.com/quick-fixes/4-reasons-why-fair-trade-coffee-scam/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=fanpage&amp;utm_campaign=new+article&amp;wa_ibsrc=fanpage" target="_blank">4 Reasons Why Fair Trade Coffee Is a Scam</a></p>
<p> <strong>&#8220;Fact&#8221; 1</strong>:  Growers Are Paid Very Little for Fair Trade Coffee.  Cracked.com says that the floor rate of $1.40 is less than the price that growers can sell on the open market, and it dreams up prices of 3 to 4 times that.  </p>
<p><strong>Actual Fact</strong>: If you <a href="http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=robusta-coffee" target="_blank">check an actual market</a>, the price is $1.02 per pound, and that&#8217;s after the grower has sold it to a distributor, and the coffee market is at a 34 year high.  In reality, most growers around the world that are selling it get around .50c per pound.  </p>
<p><strong>Terrible Analogy</strong>:  This is like a Blockbuster clerk being able to earn more cash if he just takes all the videos home and charges admission to his living room.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Fact&#8221; 2</strong>:  Consumers Are Charged Much More for Fair Trade Coffee</p>
<p><strong>Actual Fact</strong>:  A pound of French Roast that I get from a Mexican Co-op through <a href="http://www.bridgehead.ca/en/ProductType.asp?LangID=1&amp;CatID=3" target="_blank">Bridgehead costs CAD 16.67</a>, A pound of French Roast from <a href="http://www.starbucksstore.ca/French-Roast/011015571,en_CA,pd.html?utm_source=Sbuxcom&amp;utm_medium=CoffeePDP&amp;utm_campaign=11015571&amp;utm_term=Evergreen" target="_blank">Starbucks costs CAD 16.95</a>  This is even with the .10c/pound Fair Trade certification and the floor price.  If you&#8217;re paying more for Fair Trade coffee, you&#8217;re doing it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Terrible Analogy</strong>:  Otherwise, they&#8217;d just filter day-old coffee from the break room through the manager&#8217;s sock, call it something with &#8220;Nicaraguan&#8221; or &#8220;Colombian&#8221; in the name, and sell that to you</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Fact&#8221; 3</strong>: Fair Trade Is Essentially a Marketing Organization</p>
<p><strong>Actual Fact</strong>: <em>Missing the forest for the trees edition</em> Yes, they do marketing, but what they&#8217;re marketing is coffee from growers whose marketing budget would otherwise be Sweet Fuck-All, growers who would otherwise get paid less, and have no marketing.  Those bastards.  They also work with <a href="http://www.fairtradeusa.org/fair_trade_for_all" target="_blank">everyone from the World Bank to small individual farmers to try and make their lives better</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Terrible Analogy (<em>Bonus Edition</em>)</strong>:  that&#8217;s like Drew Rosenhaus collecting 50 bucks for every Terrell Owens jersey that gets sold &#8212;- This is the same relationship that Disney has with children.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Fact&#8221; 4</strong>:Growers Receive a Higher Percentage from Non-Fair Trade Coffee Sales</p>
<p><strong>Actual Fact:  </strong>This &#8220;Fact&#8221; is not really wrong, it&#8217;s just nonsense. It cites a Finnish study (which you can&#8217;t read) that says that 12% of the revenue from Fair Trade Coffee goes back to the farmers, then in the very next sentence &#8220; That is, none of that revenue [&#8230;] was making it back to their countries in any way&#8221;, so according to new Cracked.com math 12% = 0.  I&#8217;m pretty sure they&#8217;re just making shit up at this point because Cracked.com rules says pointless lists have to have more than 3 &#8220;facts&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Terrible Analogy</strong>:  the FLO is like KONY 2012 </p>
<p>And there you go.  Better than any Cracked.com article, and actually true. </p>
