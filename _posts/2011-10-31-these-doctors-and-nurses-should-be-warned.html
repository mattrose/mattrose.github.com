These doctors and nurses should be warned, however, that their work, to quote the America humourist P.J. O&#8217;Rourke will mainly involve &#8216;treating hockey injuries and curing sinus infections that come from trying to pronounce French vowels&#8217;. Ah yes, hockey. If you thought British sport was becoming crude and violent, try watching two teams of toothless brutes sliding around on ice and pausing every few minutes to beat the daylights out of each other. It makes the Premiership look like synchronised swimming. However bad Britain may seem, trust me, moving to Canada is not the answer. Why not try somewhere more appealing. Siberia, for example.
