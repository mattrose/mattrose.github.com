I was in a break once in a little race here in Pennsylvania with two riders from one team and two from another, and I was friendly with all four - and knew they were all better than me. I said, â€˜I know I can&#8217;t win and I&#8217;m not going to work with any of you, so I&#8217;m just going to attack over and over until I blow up.&#8217; And, you know, that was pretty fun. It made the last laps exciting. I don&#8217;t think those sorts of textured experiences exist in zero-sum sports.
