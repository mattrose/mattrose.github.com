see, now, to the bean counters that makes a warped kind of sense: that<br/>
 600 lbs., in their tiny little bean counter brains, somehow equals (at<br/>
 the FAA-standard presumed weight per passenger of 189 lbs.) 3.17 more<br/>
 passengers per video system removed i.e. INCREASED REVENUE! if you<br/>
 don&#8217;t show movies.  Nevermind that you cannot smash those 3.17<br/>
 passengers into the now-vacated video cabinet, that&#8217;s somebody else&#8217;s<br/>
 department.<br/><br/>
 Not to worry though, another Bean Counter will come along and the<br/>
 light bulb will go off in their tiny little bean counter brains and<br/>
 they will suggest &#8220;you know, if we moved every seat row an inch closer<br/>
 together we can fit those extra few seat in the back end and voila!, i<br/>
 get coffee &amp; doughnuts tomorrow for my brilliance!&#8221;<br/><br/>
 And who will these insular little cretins sell their bizzaro-logic<br/>
 ideas to for approval?  An executive who, if they don&#8217;t fly personal<br/>
 corporate jets to get around in the first place, if they DO deign to<br/>
 fly the airline they themselves run, they most certainly *never* fly<br/>
 Economy.  The Bean Counter&#8217;s boss&#8217;s boss&#8217;s boss brings the idea to the<br/>
 big guy, and he says &#8220;Sounds good, let&#8217;s do it.&#8221;<br/><br/><br/>
 Meanwhile the passenger base flees as fast as it can to the likes of<br/>
 JetBlue, Virgin, and SWA, because their legs don&#8217;t go numb during those<br/>
 flights, and they get to watch &#8220;30 Rock&#8221;.  And US Air is simply<br/>
 befuddled, and *cannot* figure out why their planes are only 72% full,<br/>
 while the other guys are going out with full boats because they may<br/>
 actually give a care about the quality-of-life experience of the<br/>
 passenger.
