<p>This has to be the biggest &#8220;Slow News Day&#8221; item out there. As a newsie friend put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> My last news editor sent me out to cover some pointless shit</p>
<p> before&#8230;but that might be the all-time winner.</p>

<p> &#8221;Jonesy! Grab your pad and get over to Elm Street! There&#8217;s a dog! And</p>
<p> it&#8217;s barking at a raccoon!! See if you can get the dog to comment.&#8221;</p>
