title: '‘Mythbusters’ cannonball hits Dublin home, minivan'
---
There, the 6-inch projectile bounced in front of a home on quiet Cassata Place, ripped through the front door, raced up the stairs and blasted through a bedroom, where a man, woman and child slept through it all - only awakening because of plaster dust. The ball wasn&#8217;t done bouncing. It exited the house, leaving a perfectly round hole in the stucco, crossed six-lane Tassajara Road, took out several tiles from the roof of a home on Bellevue Circle and finally slammed into the Gill family&#8217;s beige Toyota Sienna minivan in a driveway on Springvale Drive.
