<p>there’s a bluebird in my heart that<br/>
wants to get out<br/>
but I’m too tough for him,<br/>
I say, stay in there, I’m not going<br/>
to let anybody see<br/>
you.</p>

<p>there’s a bluebird in my heart that<br/>
wants to get out<br/>
but I pour whiskey on him and inhale<br/>
cigarette smoke<br/>
and the whores and the bartenders<br/>
and the grocery clerks<br/>
never know that<br/>
he’s<br/>
in there.</p>

<p>there’s a bluebird in my heart that<br/>
wants to get out<br/>
but I’m too tough for him,<br/>
I say,<br/>
stay down, do you want to mess<br/>
me up?<br/>
you want to screw up the<br/>
works?<br/>
you want to blow my book sales in<br/>
Europe?</p>

<p>there’s a bluebird in my heart that<br/>
wants to get out<br/>
but I’m too clever, I only let him out<br/>
at night sometimes<br/>
when everybody’s asleep.<br/>
I say, I know that you’re there,<br/>
so don’t be sad.<br/>
then I put him back,<br/>
but he’s still singing a little<br/>
in there, I haven’t quite let him<br/>
die<br/>
and we sleep together like<br/>
that<br/>
with our<br/>
secret pact<br/>
and it’s nice enough to<br/>
make a man<br/>
weep, but I don’t<br/>
weep, do<br/>
you?</p>
