Of course, we don&#8217;t hear about these other people, which, to me, says more about the puerility of the default world than the sexuality of Black Rock City. It&#8217;s as if radical self expression is boring, but if it means naked people on drugs, then it&#8217;s titillating, easy to condemn &#8212; and also comprehensible. Oh, I get it. You don&#8217;t get it.
