<p> you had carefully set in the corner where nothing could get to it.</p>

<p> WIRE WHEEL:</p>
<p> Cleans paint off bolts and then throws them somewhere under the</p>
<p> workbench with the speed of light. Also removes fingerprints and</p>

<p> A large stationary power saw primarily used by most shops to cut good</p>
