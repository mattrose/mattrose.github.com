<blockquote>
<p>Nocentelli went to the hotel with several of the musicians he is performing with. At the reservation desk the musicians were told, “We don’t take credit cards from those people. You have to pay in cash.” The police were called to the scene. The police have been called to the Travelodge Central for similar issues in the past.</p>
