title: 'Ah, to be scottish and drunk'
---
<p>I got this from @taylorphinney, a fantastic cyclist who posted it on twitter:</p>
<p>It starts with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A FUMING bride DECKED her kilt-wearing hubby when he sat on her knee at the reception and left a SKIDMARK on her wedding dress</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and ends with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s believed that Angus and Sarah were reconciled when they sobered up, and have no memory of the melee</p>
</blockquote>
