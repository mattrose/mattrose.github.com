title: 'Why conservatives don&#39;t seem to like urbanism - Greater Ottawa'
---
<p>I&#8217;ve only skimmed it, but I think that conservatives, especially American ones, don&#8217;t understand or appreciate the trade-offs in living in a densely populated environment.  The author of that post wonders why even conservative think-tanks aren&#8217;t concerned with urban issues, and posits that urban planning is too liberal, but those same conservative think-tanks are populated by 3-car owning, half-acre lawn, McMansion suburbanites.Â </p>
