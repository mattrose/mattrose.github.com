People love music more than they ever have and are willing to pay for music. It’s just a question of finding the best way for that to happen, without holding onto any of the past. I think with certain artists you want to hear their album and then there are other artists who I like where maybe it’s more about the single. I don’t think there is going to be one way that everything works. I think people will have many more options and choices of how to digest music, and hopefully the labels will get to the point where they are in the business of serving the audience instead of trying to hold on to an old model.
