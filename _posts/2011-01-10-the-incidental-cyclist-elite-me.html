title: 'The Incidental Cyclist: Elite? Me?'
---
<p>Randall Denley actually starts an interesting conversation about the Laurier St. bike lane, and brings up a lot of good points about why bike lanes might be bad.</p>
<p>What it boils down to is:  As a policy implementation, bike lanes work.  In city after city, the evidence shows that cities that install proper bike lanes have increased cycling.  This is the goal, and bike lanes are a proven means to achieve that goal</p>
