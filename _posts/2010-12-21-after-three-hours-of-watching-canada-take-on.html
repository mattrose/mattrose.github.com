title: 'Bar Thinks They Have Curling Figured Out | The Onion Sports Network'
---
After three hours of watching Canada take on Denmark in women&#8217;s curling Friday, regulars at the Cargo Grill in suburban Pennsylvania felt they had the rules and traditions of the sport sufficiently sussed out. &#8220;We basically think it&#8217;s like horseshoes but with ice,&#8221; bar patron Jim Comito said of the 500-year old sport. &#8220;The middle part of the bull&#8217;s-eye thing is worth two points unless they both get their pot-looking thing in the middle. Tommy said they use the brooms to clear little ice particles out of the way, but I still think it&#8217;s a static electricity thing.&#8221; By the tenth end, the entire bar felt they had enough information at their disposal to chant &#8220;Curl! Curl! Curl!&#8221; at the television.
